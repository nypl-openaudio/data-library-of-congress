00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
B..

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Of its county about this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
activity while later relayed

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
by old he took a picture but

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
only I guess a little empathy after with the parents

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
died and that makes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you right of and help her with that they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
had to bring up

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
model loosely of really

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in bed

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we did a lot had a lot of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
remodel Did he ever sleep. Well

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
grief of repartee Linda.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That's fine I think that now that your father was a good

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
name and getting them. They only gave rise to the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
building of

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the race of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the people we all describe a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
lot of do you have a pretty

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
good size. Do you know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the healing

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of of we hope to have

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
created a sense of I

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
had been he had a lot of happy and healthy happening

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
particularly early. Played with the heart

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
child of the Church

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Jesus and then

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
different kinds of support

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:31.000
by the people.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000
heaven.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
as for

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
next in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
last

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I see so you had the start of surviving the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
corners.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Or with the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
world.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Right

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
here front

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to help.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Really together

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
right.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Hard as you would have done it myself

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and I.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He probably has programs or did you have a mind.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the record

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
sounds teachers Jenny Harrison.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Yes. I think part of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
your do you happen to have

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
any

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.000
one

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
know.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
What the.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Last part of the. Party.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
In charge of

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
drawing in the

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
back.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Does have a

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
life

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.000
because I was

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
like oh it's

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
probably when it was started I said people can.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Probably

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
just where

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is she. Growing up

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and going to

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
school aged kids

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
just dissipating a lot of.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Uses for program. Did you like to

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000
see thing like my father. I know.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Yes I've

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
always liked.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
When you get

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
together. What are

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
some of the happy

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
times together and how you celebrate.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We always say from

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000
my place.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
They probably knew a lot of thing a lot of definitely that was the

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
most followed him all the time whether

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
ever

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
you have no I don't because I think for my they must resign from the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
heart anywhere

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and my father would.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But. They say.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
My

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
question when I heard all this beautiful music to say could

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
produce like to play the

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
clarinet and he loved to sing.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
my father enjoyed that was

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
just we just

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
need somebody

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to say what don't we wish we had a tape

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
recording that part of the tape was always

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
ready for

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.000
his

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
tape and

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
then

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:06.000
later

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
we just abandon the door

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and everything

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000
just

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
one

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
of your mother in the family

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
had for the family celebration has the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
special recipe special this is a serial number that was particularly

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
delayed

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.000
for the sake

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
of

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
breaking.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now that sounds and.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Everybody go where.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Good

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:50.000
morning. Go.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
That sounds fun

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
full.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
That was a quick.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Repeat

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.000
relay the

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
tape.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
For that one.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I did you ever learn how to make that famous.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Nobody would make.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They also make this case to go

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
after

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
all. This is just a

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
problem

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I had was

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
About two or more.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
After that.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
You said you came here about forty years ago. May

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
have thirty seven what actually brushes

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000
again a person.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
That

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
was pretty rough for

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
everybody and he evidently were fortunately hiding a job

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
early and that

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
was

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
about four years I

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
was great.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
But I hear tell you're not afraid of it and I said you're not afraid of working news

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
yourself. And then.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
reader

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
then the do

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
gooders

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
like you said you had your one of

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the senior workers

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
are

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.000
retiring.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Yes. Even though you could get a job in

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the Depression

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
or tail end of the Depression years it wasn't always easy.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:26.000
He kept coming back.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
wonder how they were taking care of people

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
here time. That couldn't get

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
jobs provided the few didn't need enough to keep the job right

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:54.000
away

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:19.000
left

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.000
but

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.000
you

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
think

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
about the way things are going

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
now that happening now

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and I wonder

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
you have many black families.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I saw some of their

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:51.000
my

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
work.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
didn't

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.000
but

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.000
under

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
the conditions

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
my conditions would be

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
considerably better than nine hundred seventy seven and

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
ninety

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
thirty people

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
finding places to live.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
People finally

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:44.000
got

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
you by your

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
place. Or you

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
have

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
no idea for you for

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:19.000
service.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000
That's

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000
not

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
my favorite because I think it's

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
great for you

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
for your

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
one.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Did any of them ever come

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:54.000
out

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
a

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
of.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Well that's what many people are like. But

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
I hope we

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:26.000
have a quality.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Well

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
that's what I

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:40.000
think we hastily Bremen.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But I either come at the same again and she would like

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
to tell me about your families or your

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
sister or your mother. Did

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
you as a child were you talked to or do any of those sort of thing.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
But. Here.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And I imagine this started when you were quite young.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You think of

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
my grandmother was a

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
family to say learn to bake

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
bread when they had to stand up on a little

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
chair in order to see where they were too

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
short and they were taking them about. And

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
more than a funny.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Well

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
it's wonderful to be talking to

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
restart. I'm sure

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
they helped you with your family the Rodino now the

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
same life many of

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
our young people that get married

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
today probably never been in a

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:34.000
kitchen. A place.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Can

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Ride for.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Last year was your garden right on

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
your property.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And we're with this you're

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
relating to a

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Campbell

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Quest QUEST there

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
now. That's how they are saying

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.000
the.
