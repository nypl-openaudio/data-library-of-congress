And there's niggers in school but I don't have any my

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000

they were kind of friends there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I mean because there are age maybe I don't think I play some

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because I would know she'd be a legal question but she probably makes sense and I go from the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
