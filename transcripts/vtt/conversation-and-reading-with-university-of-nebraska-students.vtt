00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000

stretch here and there was it going are good don't care if you have some

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
orange flowers bloom aside the road. Suddenly the rain came down in torrents.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And then the roof of our car again to wreak we're sorry that we hadn't fixed

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it before leaving home. There are playing and plans and involves so many

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
details that we hadn't thought of our clothes or had observed so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
much dampness that we felt cold so we hurried into the next village.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Mary I rather think your Baptist nephews more shooting going to marry the nice girls I'm going to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
be used to work in his

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
office the wagon used to carry the saddle in her she's up

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
They had a heated debate on American income

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
tax the girl is usually coming out when his horse

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
into him in the fine art he shouted himself

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
for the naked dirty of his reasoning processes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
basic judgment is what you'd expect of a coupon clipper

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the idea of such warmth in February.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We had a fine time in his house last night but his poor wife was worried whether she should

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
serve oysters in such a hot weather.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I asked how much how he expected just don't you to solve any problem.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The news maybe fall where the facts are so uncertain he burial

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
himself with the word old he cursed.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
