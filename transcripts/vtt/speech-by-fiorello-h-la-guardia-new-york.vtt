00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is the carol N.E.H. American English dialect recordings

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
collection produced with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Center for Applied Linguistics. Tape number one side a.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
must talk now about what we are going to do.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And plan

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
accordingly. And I want to express my

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
thanks to Judge Samuel see

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Barry who has given so much to this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
city who has made clean government possible in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this that they always started before

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
thirty four remember my campaign of nineteen twenty

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
nine when I've told the city about rotten conditions that existed here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Remember when I was nominated by the Republican Party in twenty

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
nine and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
grabbed the next day. I was a hard day. Remember that way that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was Dr

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Reid but it was useful wasn't that. The charges that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
are made was so startling that. Said hardly be

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so and Judge Seabury proved beyond any reasonable doubt

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of all the charges of I may want to I want to thank God.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I also want to thank a group of

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
friends who got together.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And petitions as it were for my nomination. I know

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you meant

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
well and I know you were interested only in good government and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I want to thank each and every one of you for your

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
confidence and for your coverage. And for your own

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
selfish

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
interest in ours that.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But of course that isn't my technique when I want

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
a nomination. I submitted to the people and not

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to political

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
bosses but it did bring

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
out the fact that we must elect a mare this year.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And I want to make very clear that I appreciate very kind of that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I will not anti the Republican primaries.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I am not a candidate. For the Republican

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
nomination for mayor.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now there are other groups.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I want to make that clear again that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the decision must be left to the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
people I want to ask my buddy good friends of the American

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Labor Party not to nominate me and not

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to put my name on there but NATION.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I am not going to run for mayor this year I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
had many reasons. And I will give them to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
you but you know.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's been so amusing and to observe

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
panorama in the last few months this

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
panorama of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
politicians this panorama of scheming and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
conniving to do want to join forces to the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
strong I a going to win this race.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Of course it's always difficult for the gentry of that kind. To get together

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
at every KSAN and cause. Belo and

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Adonis the rest of the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
racketeers perhaps have not yet

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
agreed on having a bank and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you have you know seen all this maneuvering. Yes and some very high officials.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Holding certain offices that are not supposed to be in politics have

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
been brain trusting some of this convince and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
conspiracy to the story good government.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Because I knew all along my friends this decision was made

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
yesterday or today this decision was made back in nineteen

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.000
forty

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
one and so

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that. I've been carrying on with the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
full knowledge of what I was going to do knowing that the job was completed.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And that now. It was up to the people of this city to

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
decide whether they want to keep clean diesel government put clean law abiding

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
people in our city for the children of our

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
city whether they want to return to the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
political reflect. That the in home which is losing the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
racketeers in the tin box that's for the people to decide.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And I must be decided on that issue alone and for instance at the other

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
evening at the national Republican Club there was quite a debate on the subject and there

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
you have a level of intelligence somewhat higher than the discrete

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
clubs and what was the discussion that well look why do you support the governor

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
next year and we support him this year how do we know that we would

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
support the government next year you

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
have Howard general. I don't

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
know and I would make any such dirty deal.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I don't know who I'll support next year it all depends on the issues and the

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
candidates

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
but when I want to point out. Is that the selection of

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
a candidate for the mass should be only on fitness. And

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
not on any political Expedia I'm sorry.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Now but there are many reasons why I think.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I shouldn't run.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
First there is always the danger of.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
One becoming sort of stale in office. When I don't want to be become

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
stale at any

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
time I don't want to become indifferent. I don't want

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to become so callous that I couldn't get indignant.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Yes and impatient didn't lose my temper when I hear a graph on corruption.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
When I hear of crime and recognizing Oh I don't want.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I'd want to go all that way and then there's also a tendency.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
That administration may become satisfied. It becomes sort of us. No

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
getting satisfied that we're doing so well.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh no no no no no no that's not good I want to keep on my toes all the time I want my

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
government to keep on its time was all the time I committed to be on their

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
toes and their. Change is

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
good and then another thing you know if an individual in in an executive office

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
too long he may become bossy and they tell me

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm sort of inclined that way at parent. So that's something

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
else I miss look at.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But now here is something that I think is important I do not believe that

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
in our form of government. A key chief executive has

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
should be real acted time after

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
time the government of the city of New York is so large

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that it cannot be compared with smaller

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
municipalities our. So the government is larger and greater and more

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
involved than that of any state in the union including our

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
own and so while it may be good in a small community for

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
one to stay on the job as mayor. I don't think it's whom some in

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the city on a government as big as ours rotation in office.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Is good and is

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
wholesome it is necessary. In a

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
democracy it does not mean that because we have a rotation.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It must necessarily go from bad from good or bad or from bad to worse.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
If that were true it would indeed be a sad commentary on our

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
democracy and in these times there's a tendency

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to rally around and individual.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
It is our democratic system that is important today

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
not individuals in a democracy can not be up

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to retained and improved so

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
proper rotation in

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
office then something is wrong with the system and

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I refuse to believe that there is anything wrong with our democratic

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
system when I can almost hear you

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
say there goes one idea again using

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
consistent even to support the president for a war.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Yes I

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
did and under the same circumstances I would do

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
it again under different circumstances I would

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
not have done it. It did not require a great student of

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
history on an expert on European politics in one nine hundred

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000
forty to

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
know that our country would be involved in

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
war. Did not require much of a military genius to

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
know our complete and utter lack of

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.000
this

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
offense and of military preparation in nineteen forty.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I knew that even our own coaches out here. Was

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
not properly protected and we had no means of

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
protecting in those

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
days it would not be long before the real conditions that existed nine

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
hundred forty and the frantic preparations and the building up of our the fence of our

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
coast and mainland will become

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
history. I had some little part in the preparation of

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that as a member of the permanent join boy. On the

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
fence with Canada.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
No one in our entire country had the knowledge of European

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Affairs and the grasp of the situation at that President Roosevelt.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I did not like the third term.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I don't think the person themselves like the third or I supported

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
him because under those conditions and the danger that we were facing at

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the time I consider that the best interest of our country that the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
president should remain in our place

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
in one thousand and forty four no other

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
decision could be made there was no choice.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And of course the American people

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
responded a great many of my very good friends who

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
are really interested in clean and none political government worked hard

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
to drive out the forces of

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.000
corruption from city

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
hall and were responsible for my

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
election back in nineteen thirty four they were

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
hurt and disappointed that I did support the president in

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
ninety four. I did it with my eyes open.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I knew that I was hurting my

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
friends and that they were disappointed. I was sorry and told them at the time

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I did what I believed was the best interest of

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000
our country. Now.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Of course.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
As these machines are created. They have

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
terrible power. My friends if in nineteen thirty four when

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I came here I would just to play along with

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
a political

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
party it would not have been difficult to build up a powerful machine

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
this thing or I could have built up a personal

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
political machine. What I could not have given you the kind of government.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
That you had for twelve years and that I know you wanted.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The city would not be as it is

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
today. And I would not have

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
been myself. I know politics

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
well and you know that I know and could

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
have built up quite a powerful political machine. Others have done it.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And some are doing at him then

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
state today. I was

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
interested in the future of my city. I was

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
not interested in my own political future.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I did not

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
hesitate look around your study

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
now where are the politicians in office

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and Valentine and Walsh control any

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000

all but they know their

Bob Moses the builder it tried it once it couldn't get many votes from itself

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000

Some years of useful service left

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
