My husband was a mechanic except when we were in one camp Well then
he helped with
the. Men in the it's and. And
then one one camp that my father had little sound mail and they
thought that ice. Then one that was getting closer and he brought a
little sawmill and they thought that I didn't need them on ready
but I saw
now that was reluctant yes
almost
no.
And producers to how capable those men are We had one. They used to call
him
Big Sam or would leg it because he
had lost his one leg railroad
accident. And he was a big
man already an alder
man and you know how they get on now when four of
those trees. And I went. We didn't have many
men more so I had lost the time to watch it walk when they were close to
the camp and watch him follow those trees
and I watched him and cut that granted.
So I he stood with that he made his own lake. He
never bought ID Fishel he made his own from a piece of
wood and hitched a hitch the wires and everything and and nothing
else around no
waste and a strap around here and he always the men said that
when he went to bed he took it off and laid it down beside him he always sleep the
lot. But he stuck to it that. Thekla lake.
On top of that tree just not like the rest of them.
He was he was a man for the cleanest man he think
when he was drinking
but he never hurt anybody by talking or
he was always soul needs otherwise talked so clean. You wouldn't
have to be afraid of him
or ever think anything about it you know the real Chantel

Yeah OK. You know when you grew up in.
Into your analogy to the valley. You
know we
were yeah you know we had a little farm far own.
With into too much farming though. Now I know the sun has the
farm all over and he's made a way out there and I don't think
you know what he had last year he had some knowledge there but the beret last is
also very.
Well what was it like when you grew up there. It did what kind of how did your day start the start of the
chores and things.
You know we can get up early before you went to school but yeah like Oh when we were
at that home and went to school yeah you had to get up and so we
are buying chores and feed the cattle and so
on the new head of the school and sometimes when you
came home from school to to
your lunch home but then you had to get
some hit
some hay for the house and then get ready in that hour
and go back to school we weren't too far from the school
about but would it be about half a mile from here.
And then get back to the classes and same thing when you come back home
can show close
and. Get Your than.
Wired to fall. Take care. Well what sort of things.
Did you do for recreation. What kind of games did you play
for the last couple out the son of. Another a
vast one. They could get as good and there wasn't too much.
There was something that they used to call summer time but
winter time we used to have skinny and there was a little hill there but we did. If
we went with the skis to school. Well we piled two three pair of
skis together and then all piled on the ski sent just went down the
hill. And there were none would since some of
the boys made a lot calls in the water a little cabin and
all that. There wasn't really much to
do and they had a little skating on there but that
wasn't much of a foot
to reduce them though
I did and I fell down and I hurt my head the first time about the skates
on and
that's that's the end of my skating work they were there with
those clamp on things you have to plan for and when you were those the lumberjack
around robbers for the skates didn't stay good on those
gun but we got them from our teacher for Christmas fresh and I am
a sister and they just want to stay on the right way.
I mean yeah. Yeah.
You said you played cricket. Ticket to get test get over you
played well
you go in a circle and then one course around and they're saying and.
Then the one that has a handkerchief or a stick or something and you just go around
and trot that and if he notices for he or you
put it down you have to run and catch the one
that Ruster And if you get attacked Well then you have to
change or
yeah every original Down was.
Co-opted by law I don't know how you explain that but that was not that most of us.
You played a brawl. You had your homes and your sticks and you
were here and
here. And it's four or five and you had
your whole in here and then the middle one north with the ball and you try to
hit with the wrong. Throw hit it so it would hit somebody and when
you hear step on the new to the whole if you hear that and then that one had to
be in the center
and hit. Oh
yeah yeah.
Too much you
really can't think of
anything fast like.
Alaska loaned to us.
Glasgow. While couples. Couples on how
many couples you want like this one in the front here and around
they holler last couple out what this go around like this and this he's
this one here. That's a single one tries to
catch one of them. So the one that's left without the prior
sheet of these one and that one that catches Well they will be in the front and then.
The one that was left along with it then that'll call and then this last one world
for good or circles around
like everybody could Yeah and that's sort of like.
Yeah. You know. You mentioned it used to go to dances.
Did you go in the days when you were in the
bar you know that's how I want to know we said I want
to feel transitory rock wintertime because it was too far to
go around that in the winter time with the girl. We hired
on bass who of us or something and gone to the swamp with
a shorter.
And that. Twenty
times and about our on the road.
It was so far too well and there was not a highly and of course at that time the kids didn't have
cars at
all so and they came with the horses too and usually their
horses were
in father's Harned same with
the Elmer when there was
a team of horses and they canceled there was quite a few when the one played and
the with a kid. Yeah well how would the most
British people
mostly Finnish evil there are still floodlit hat he'll enlist people
that came voice from there but not too many most of
them
are. But teacher he was too cool and
oh yeah. These were allowed to go to yeah that was the only entertainment there was.
And the things they had just mark and concern. Well in stockings
