00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The next excerpt is also taken from original tape W one forty eight.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Always a read fear that whatever it was spies

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
this year nice and seventy and we're having another war with Russia.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And one of our top secret agents

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
had information from the very important information that we've

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
been on the way to war we got off the plane and the United States has

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
booked let's pause and had on the waited for to see

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that they had

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
access and he. He was the guest of the car

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
door and he has a little plot in his

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
brain and if they operated to be mislead Hardy What do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you tell the news mission. So the ignore

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the miniature age and the true station and.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They miniaturize.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The ship that was made to go on the water especially look for

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
water did see Joe. They used to for this

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
purpose to well let's rise to say the germ and put it through

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is a lead system with a laser gun to let them

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
live quite during

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
this whole thing they had to go through it of course

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
were Poles were vain and lovingly me. And isn't the time

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to look for what would be noticeable when the signs of the day were poor

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and small and so was the gentleness of a man who Darfur

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
loans

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and in a lot of this mess and you know smokes. So in

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the last the cotton along and they won't see that they were they had a chart

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that they didn't want to sure. So well see where they were and they got caught inside the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
love and. There was reason they had Grandma inside so what we know

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
now. We have a code little holes and won't get back to the ship was

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
nice so well after that that was to the back

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of the Jones moving through easier than anybody made the slightest

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
noise I'll say it was and be blown

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
apart and after hour as they went out of his body you know the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
ship blew biggest natural size. So if they do they got

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a little blood clot that that was the alternate there we were getting

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
out of last time they got called up for the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
laser going broke so you had a brick contacting the outside and use

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.000
partially as

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a receiver is that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
talk to the outside fix the laser because that's they need when

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they could have done it with a knife that was the time we just made another

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
club so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of they fix the legs going to have no concept. So well

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
they couldn't tell they were near as they really made a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
noise. They was a lot

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
up so they don't like us here it was in the brain and under stress this is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a whole ship. Bob and a nurse in a ship no

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.000
nurse

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
outside and goes to the ER and the ship.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Starts bottles and turn and. Finally to go through

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the blood. They did a blood clot on the way back to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
get caught in another vein artery. Does bear on the whole way around the brain

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
again and

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
then out pick up

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
a certain of they need to come out from the ice when they

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
die they did something to make the hear anything was

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
guess the canals who carried out and they had to pick it up with the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
syringe and put it back on the. The table.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Then they use the machine to move learn to get the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
many size four man one woman she's the.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Foreman and more lazy and lazy trying to Mays ago and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
they also thought that each of those flattened guess because they have a spy in

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the ship. He sort of like. Everybody was important

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the man that read the map. He made it wrong and he was in to kill the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
guy who killed who pulled out a long track of the lady with a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
laser gun was a kill

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
guy to block the laser was happening that they suspected

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
her and then they suspected that red leapt because a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
they had this World Pool said he said you have no time to know

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
about that. I suspect and the man in

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
charge of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the transmitter that they thought that was the reason

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
he was in was break contact. So then the girl. And

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
there's only one guy did it but that was the one who's there

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
who made the ship Neferet purpose.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Who had made the ship we knew. He had made for on the ground under water and not

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
for going to

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
see how many people were there in the ship

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
three or four men and one girl. What are you saying that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The lady was in charge of the laser once. The ship was a map

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
it was well for the transmitter and the little

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
man he knew even he had made ships and he knew every piece of it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So when the yes applied man you know what the six and the plane did

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
run out and the cook this is before they broke contact and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
they couldn't breed that here because it was. And there were many

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
tries and the particles in the ARE be too big for them to breathe so

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
they had to miniaturizing the and they had moved

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
here. To move up

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the personalities of the characters and humans but the people the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
right people. There was scared. You know to

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
me you know how to use it ever

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
since they were suspicious but at the end you suspicions were

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
moles you know because they they all had a right to because the laser broke the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
air filter one

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
off and the one that's the perpetrators

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
never wanted I say Dorothy you brought us this way into the whirlpool.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So they all were suspicious of whatever the city and then they came out of

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the ice and knew all and would was glad it

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
over and they had one second to go for the go. They didn't get out no one says

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.000
we

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
should be there and I would say yes and

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
who killed in the summation and who is this man

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
who yesterday say you know.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
OK. He

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
was knows the justices outside Well this man was slain

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
on stretcher. She was also a lot of such was in the room. But the man

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
was on the

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
stretcher while they were in his body. I

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
think of the

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
miniaturized to image that Pullman was he had the right.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This was a new travel and it looked to them and Mitchell right

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
looks like a process.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
He was a little container. So was there

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
a machine they called a while

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
though it was a big one and pick them

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
up and put him out of the. Platform new deuced again.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Then they will put.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
pretty sure they would put on a platform and you do

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
see a third to vote. Side

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
mostly and then and. Then they will lose to get

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and reduce the size we pull back and the

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
was picked up for I would say. We do some of

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
those ten home use of an inch and then fall back in the water and then reduce

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the whole thing was there but this had

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
a radar of some sort of radar that it

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
could sense where they are in

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the water. So the nurse put the needle in there and pulled

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
up and was in there and they told you that the needle.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
That's all she know and then

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
they and they they cleared out. Not only

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that they put in blood his type of blood and the same thing and they put

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
his

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
arm in his arm and they would lose all were

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
both here they got caught in the world Paul two So good

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
to hear they were supposed to lose here.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
They're going to put up on the news break. Oh.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Yes I hear you know he was came here to go on the

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
whirlpool of my neck and we not only don't lose

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
a into his lungs.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
They got a long and then they go

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
who I think is named of a widow of

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Lola violin that's the this size. Alyssa I never knew was

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
whose really was your any qualms with

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
people

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
you know the windows but the walls they all kept on I

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
just. This is this is this is this.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
What what. How far you can go places.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So just like the sending

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
those ships are out of control those aircraft with

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
bombs on it and these are radio

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
controlled by something happens the transmitter Lou are some of the most lethal as

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Nasscom was just one of the most common.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So that's a down. Yes but of I read the book already.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And I like to use again I was S.S. So how do you know

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
if it's good I read

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the whole book and. Said.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They so Marcellus's lost all of those

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
people says Weston drop a bomb in New York. The bomb to

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
go and really look at the why they

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
drop the most car weapon right off. No system was involved.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
New York and the president was in New York that she got to leave the

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000
one.
