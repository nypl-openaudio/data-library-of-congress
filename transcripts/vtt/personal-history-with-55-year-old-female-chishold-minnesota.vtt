00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
next excerpt is taken from original tape W two twenty

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
one of the places

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the tempo.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Run cheaper on. Upon Time for

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a kick the cat and I don't

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
see why I can plumage.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You know the friendly restamp teams and only ours have the only kid to take the little kids

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.000
read

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
down. And one read that one team would run in the other and I'd have

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to find by Niemi Arrow

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
isn't that true. And or we even grow a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
spine you Ronit in a crisis then it wasn't it wasn't on top like it is or

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
not we had more empty life to hide in vibrations and stuff but now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you have to really go out to find someplace died and actually hidden some of these giant mice an oppressive

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
stark thing you're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
trespassing so but then there wasn't it wasn't nearly back up and I got it on

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
her Saturn step right to hit a tree there wasn't much beyond the street to bring

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
cars past fact a member of people rock and I at once said about us that their car was to put him

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in pasture Arkwright right now is a bond second trip

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
school so and when I was young they used to bring cars out there to pasture

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to school but only now that we had a car when I was little.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It will. Yeah we have done.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I think we are calling to mind Dad bad I was eight years old on my dad bad so that was twenty four and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
eight thirty two years.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He didn't use the opportunity

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to purge. The humor of any of the right in

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the middle I would be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the one.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
mentioned divisive the rest of the.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You know I've never had a bicycle. I had a pilot from one of our neighbors.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
My girlfriend and I neither one of us had a bicycle she was a foster child and of course I was but my dad

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
was debts we step to pay a dime. To rent the best support on the place and we have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to let them ride it up to the theater and we picked it up there and then we drive it until

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we knew the show was over and then we'd have to bring it back to the show

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they use our van to run to the show and then they'd ride the bike on with after that.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I don't

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
know.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Simply put. Not too much because an encore left came from

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the live three miles from here in Houston. Kim stated our host. And he's never

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
cried repair garage for

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
cars and he used to have a credit hour in there playing cards and I can remember.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Alright we just had abstract more than fixed at the time so we slept in the front turn

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
up and called my sister and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I and my mom called and his friends would be in the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
kitchen bankcards around around to about and I can still hear certain that flew around

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
her drawers mirror. Whenever I mean those cards because that I think

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I heard so much of these guys playing that they never really impressed me to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
play cards I just thought it was a big waste

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of time.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So when you know.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I never liked them and I still don't.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So I don't hear the shooter which

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
was. At times like here

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
in the winter time it's winter time trying time to watch

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
T.V. I sit next and watch T.V. but otherwise

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
not to the people. I

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
don't know do I know. They're all pretty

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
nice operator all the same I think I like. Name that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
tune or something that somebody is using their musical talent to name all

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the songs

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
or something because I can't remember names so I think I'm impressed when somebody

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
our young can remember songs from way back you know that I think

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or by Remember that and I like it but I never remember the name of it you know. But

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
otherwise not

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
really. And I'm sure that sounds good

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
on

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
those grounds and then

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that's And then they compete against each other and then it's ten thousand dollars

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
if you. If you win and it's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
on two nights a week or one night only

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
rest is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
good but it takes them a couple weeks to do

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it against the fence and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
all

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
those I'm less of an ace ten thousand bad when they really

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
are to me but you just literally

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
went to

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the ground making sure that rhyme

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
like we had a housekeeper too I have to get the maids in to do the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
cleaning depending on how many rooms we have how many men to call and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
make sure that the laundry is

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
done. Make sure that their reservations are

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
kept in their daily report to do and then the night has and I got it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and shipped it has something but during the day shift you're busy more with checking out

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
then checking and. The people usually check in at night and then I have to check them out in the morning with

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a major

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
report calling and the maids doing their

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
work and make sure that the keep their ad weekly and

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
then. So now we have the bass on here to us so we have

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
our tickets sounding and package sending and the Chamber offices here

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
quest to grab a ten thousand steps when they go like not in the afternoon if their telephone

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
rang I would have to answer

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
some sort kind of a combination of more. Best friends.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.000
All

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you want to hide if you are real busy and I

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
don't think we get much busier than a motel car. We might have to have somebody come in

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and answer

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the phone and sell the tickets for the bass. Because when you're in a motel your guests are first and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
you're. Trying to answer some of these questions on the telephone and are past their jobs

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and somebody wants to check the N.R. check out. You can keep calling on their way time on

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
the phone for the subject keeps getting busy like it is right now we

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
might have to get somebody

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and read about that legacy special we have only two buses going in the city.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So at least we had an hour before an hour after so they could sell the tickets or

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
something but that's just something that we're not now likely that arrives

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
the heart of the cigarettes and out of the supply

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000
then so don't ever stop and make sure they're not ways.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Now or not it's kind of interesting. We'll do. One of the nicest chaps I've

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ever had

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I. Mentally made them work and a little bit harder

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but this is the easiest physical job I've ever had

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
with her never throw Gibson's skirts the goods and

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I was kind of manager that I don't know they call your manager but you're not we

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
are under the hood being a star so I don't know what do

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
you manage around a manager but your to an

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
assistant sure they had one in the App Store that you didn't have the capacity to do that most

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
managers do it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We're just

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
grab fast track I already started to break into it I kinda like you know

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I never went to college just graduated from high school now rest in the factories during

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the when I was in Detroit. I ran thread now

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
machine. Inspections.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Put the tribe

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
screws. It's awfully hard

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to put a different sizes in Crescent and star aka star after just a

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
little run and then I don't really like that because that was a really fast

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that you do on ten

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
member about a big amount and run an hour. It was kind of

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the present piece for better at reading both expected you to make so

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
many screws an hour and then as you crack better then the you

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
could if you would learn

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to change the cameras on your machine and make bigger screws around then

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
maybe you need bigger ones to work in the new kid with a smile and fabric that tried that on

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
the machine that ran on three pieces an hour. That was really grasp of the new time.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I mean year after year that Arnie just time those

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
things and if you were next to somebody someone crying or they hollered you were downstairs having

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
a small whatever you were doing on that front your machine was running it was

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.000
no

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
problem. All right that clown.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Screwed. My ass. I don't know if you'd call it the five thousand by the school

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
but a different kind of I said it was higher level but the thread was on the outside and it was a

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
real crisis of course that I would say it was

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
about six inches long. Maybe longer but it was hard just

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
a peaceable it looked like a piece of rope. And then the thread was cut but the thread

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
was really outside of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
seventy five between and just and then it wouldn't burn

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
or nothing you could just see this coming in that red letter hundred or a little

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
tiny ones you

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
know and your plants and real fast not the kind of monotonous to

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
me with. No I have no

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
idea who was doing the rounds that was for some more material of some kind I

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
suppose I don't.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Rat

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I think our eyes.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
To bilk I like I like places. One things to do but I don't like such

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
a constant rush. Like in the student ever is growing in such a

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
great little place crying just to admire a minute then rather going

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
there faster than we are.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And it's too big and I think nobody knew each other there they didn't trust anybody and I

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
lived in that one and I knew one family in the apartment building that's actually good for them

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
changed over so fast they'd either move for their job or something going on

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I do I just don't like it I don't like when I have to be closed up an apartment in our party.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Not bad for coffee I don't like to mix and keep bothering our bombing

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.000
our

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
time but if Iraq or if I'm sick I

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
like to they haven't seen me for Raaz not that the dry run how are you or good morning

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
or something I don't

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
like to be in a place where nobody says good morning or put by a good night or nothing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You know I

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
just I'm not that kind of a person I like people and I like to be friendly with people I

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
don't like to be called in and I'm hearing a lot I mean knowing your and that talk to me a

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
big city is because they don't know

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and don't care and I For that let's just call on then like I said

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
for now married in the same house I'm living in

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
now and I know my neighbors coming and going.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
You know if you've been in the

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
situation.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
With only one or

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
two months I didn't I didn't even know I had gullible I

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
just had a couple of higher taxes back

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
there and I asked when I got this heart

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
attack because I never complained about food or

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
anything and my daughter and myself on them back.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I was asking her back because that's how gall bladder

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
attack. And because the doctors at that time doctors the stuff

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
coming to the home. So they had him when he was there about three o'clock in

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
the mining on that knowledge ladder so that

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
after that I went to the

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
clinic. Traumatic bad right of return never knew I had and then I didn't have any storms or

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
anything and it was just I had so many attacks not knowing what they were and so that's

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
what was giving me the trouble was the adhesions that had been left

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
on the attack. To that

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
other people. And to allow to put me on

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
a diet for me to lose either way

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I was forced to lose forty

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
pounds and I stayed on is that where you had to because

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
otherwise really good sex from a lot of that food like any product or anything with

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
a kernel like anything with a

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
house and. I had

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
lost her. Last thirty five or thirty three pounds and I

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
just couldn't. This was like the mayor and you know.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Take until I thought that the last four times I had about thirty three or thirty

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
five and I went and I told them to pack or you have to take it out now or forget

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
i family.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Didn't really have to but you know you were to the degree to be honest and I figured this was a really good

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
stuff took it out and I had no problem I

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
was up and added real quick.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
You know you.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I just. I would pass that bread I'd

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
never really rest.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And then when they told me that or there's going to be nothing out right now and they're just

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
really cocky and greater than and then when she came out I thought Oh my goodness

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
do automatic surgery they have lived in and battled present battles

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I.V.'s and everything and I just thought Oh my goodness today everybody come out of surgery looking back but I

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.000
have never

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
been battling. That had had surgery I had never seen anybody come out of surgery.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So I'll just assume when you came out of the out operating room you were had they were given your blood

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and I.D.'s and everything and I just wasn't going to do that I just figured I wasn't sick enough

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to procure what I thought I was seeing.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So that when they talked to me they told me I had it was wrong with her and I had they had done to

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
her and they said well my nose can be nothing like that one

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that I run in and I read fine when I came out in fact.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It put me in the same room with that woman because it was right next to the desk for intensive

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
care and I got out of bed. That evening

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and I had scolded for that and as we said

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
we're back to Iraq to the bathroom and they said it's

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
our right that was in there that Alex let me call the nurse.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They're not to go on this so what did you do you were driving a battle I said are going get excited is here I

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
got a phone on the door.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
But you sure are weak but you can start rocking and I'm propounding there was something from that from my bed

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
all the way Brad

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
saw it but it wasn't bad.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And that's the worst. Now I'm a

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
diabetic and I don't like being a diabetic.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And I'm not forced to but I do and cheating all the time in the ass not bread.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I don't seem to have the

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
world not to do it.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
When you were sick. Or did your

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
mother or

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to me or the call the doctor who can afford it. My mother was a widow she could

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.000
not afford

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
a headache but I can remember my mother Raqi I never had a headache but my

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
sister used to get them and my mother used to take

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
arrive and depart and been a grand lot of warm water and

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
vinegar and they have been eagerly to regret asking my sister to this day I said that that's already.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Directed this day

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
something about that vinegar she said I love the smell of and dryers are all wrapped

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and she says little.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
The afternoon. What

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
about two

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
feet.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I ran them through the step grass when I was little I have chubby

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and rational and cheerful. So I never really asked my sister a sex

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.000
slave

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
but she wasn't that kind of a

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
clean.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Sister. You

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
know and that's fine but really when we had a quarrel. It was never caught Sarah personal economy.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Or warn me

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
off and I mean it was less just ordinary stuff and we just used to go to

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
bed and just it just kind of behavior

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
catalyze then he just some of that kind of stuff can keep you warm or stressed

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
or curb our. Make you feel high

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
or something but never really

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
on medications

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
lose.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Or lemon and. I lemon into you but because my mother's percent brazenness Honey

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
don't know.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
You

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.000
know I never

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
took. Going

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
to.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I was in line I was a little scared. Already as we went

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
up

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
to Bear River and then to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
the train and he had a little religious car. And the

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Willis. I remember that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
They're willing to have my mother

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and my sister and myself that my son and my

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
father's girlfriend and I sat

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
in them just the rumble seat.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And we went to Mass on time and it was late when there's something on

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
my name. So my clothes off and I ran back to the

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
rumble and were slowed way down. We're late. We're tired and have

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.000
a plane that

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
crashed and you know for cell asleep.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
We were all I can remember northern in them to the name of the people with

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
the cavern store like the all you know in the country are they have a combination of everything.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And people fighting the T.V.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
doing that and writing I was like I say I

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
was asleep like my rest of them in the front

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
seat and the woman was no more than when we came

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
she just jumped him out for tight entire jury and he went in the ditch. But

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
she landed right on

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
the foot of the car. And she died

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
but from the day we come through and of the mention.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
But she was drunk and her and her husband were fighting and the sheriff said it was sad

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
but they

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
knew they raided every day. For cars because they were fighting so bad

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
and in fact when they went to find her husband he was sleeping in the woods should they have had just a big plate to

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.000
do

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
for that little bit. And she decided she just had my son and nothing

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
else just that night down on.
