Well it was anything or anybody losing and that it was.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Thomas Mallon as

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
a human is

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Grew it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
about when I played.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It involved a good

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
deal that moved up

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
here Bill Clinton who delivered the when women

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
bring the members

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Miami really come up.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
In the banking and.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
The ground rules and pressure the whole

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
thing

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to go. I guess he must have been no.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Need to move on with the practice.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
He really

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
did. When

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they lived

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
whose postmaster.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Ligeti no congesting Kanchan.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Yeah that was what the two of the move attention

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
were here when he was running when I

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
came back

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the same thing you're going to.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But it was my

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
last eighty percent out being Muslims and don't you mean

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the news is no longer the most going to movies on

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
T.V. They use terms like ours and by the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
way why games are abstracted camped on this one who is

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
very all of that group Claire clean all thing they use the campfire

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
thing and you say I feel I was I'm going to have feelings and all that I read

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
was just a private Oh all knew it was all cleared up they up.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And they would hail all kind of different kind of animals and things

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
there that's really clay own back pain.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And they come and they are determined in covering language might that arise

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
again with kids on the way to and that the timeline for just going to it

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is they eat B. C.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and put in a home where we said to the cause then you have cancer or would

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
you rather then they would get to far from different places and you would camp be

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
unable we mean they were two or three nights before we move on going

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
forward we were right here in this

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
NG You were living in a half

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
long time running film that is forty five

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
years ago.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Boning this guy see again

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
the hero's first car you have so.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I don't remember the causeway so real that.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Here around first

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
are you. Where was it

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and would be

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
homeless were having the background they have

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
a car say Rand they're going to say hey come the times you

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that look at this I see.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You. Yeah.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is some of some of the homes. Why don't the

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
policy process. This

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
is a really little airplane

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
to kill

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
them freedom coming from

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:37.000
all our rights.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
When this

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
community front of their own label said one

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
of

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the things almost a

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
very plainly playing

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
patient will be deceived

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
by Big Oil I

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
say Yes I don't know about them people

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
who did tell Maison police when

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
they got on but you think

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
clearly but I know you

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
don't like it was no one would call the police take care

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
then sell it but you

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
go. And use the cowards. So many of these

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
have to have seen the parallax while

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
you live

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
here and then your buff to do some more you go to prison I think

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
will bring

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
down magnesium all these two

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
years then you. You say well you are here when this

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
green

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Iraqi man Brian.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.000
That's

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
who they are.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Queer is a loaded question of over from our friends at the next

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
crossing from you where you live you have

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
your own no I didn't I didn't have to

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
will hire you the all right I will NEVER I'm constantly

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
in this school because it's our rule right in front of

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
our rather proud though I call it knowing where

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
you want a chair. All right all alone now and me.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We will grow up in

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
from and Haley's for yours then we had to have a

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
checkbook right Dave alone amazes and there where we went to church

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and Sunday

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
schooling in the wrong way we had to walk

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
there. That little boy didn't have didn't have a

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
chance there the him you see you have a chip salesman. We will go in

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the school as it was at school then you build a church sayer.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And it shifted.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
My mother and father was there was they were our

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
C.M.E. that was a C.M.E. a chit that

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
it led them to Methodist to

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
this and then I later on this when the New Years come along why build

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
this in the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
church like you call it had

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
