00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
was advised to wording

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that limitation came from the ME.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Sure there were years ago.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And when it's your own little interest in

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
me to use it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in an hour so lo and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
behold we got a call from this young man that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
was in a folder and he hit it up into

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
it with a bright. So all the time he was in there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so why isn't the girl told anybody

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so we're by to visit them to placate

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the couple they have here have a world away

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
morning with down to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the Catholic

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Church in Kansas City.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Lasted about fifteen minutes and you didn't know long or what

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was the whole lot of music. It

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
was in the is everything this is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
where it would have been the player you know had she still been living there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There's little doubt about merit is only lending a hand may be a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
good thing and she's married young man twenty six

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
so he seems to really have a lamb and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
this is going way his head

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
right with his family taking care of the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
little children they have and the grandmother and the grandfather and and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
everything we ever ever had was. You know he had to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
give or I think you probably will have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
some happiness. Sample himself

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
maybe. I have a little going back to the house

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
for a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
really

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
really understand but I guess that's the way they do in

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
their way of doing things.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Anyway the wording was lovely and she had two

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
girls.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And two young the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Blazers came to blows.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
She wasn't given away.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
When they all marched down and there was a little back up

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in the back of the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
bell saying in saying that it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
was in

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the sale and one time that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
it interested me that the bilingual never

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
once been touched. I guess is

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the habit he put his ring in the ring. They

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
had community. And then

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
people in the church in his

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
view there were only about ten or eleven in there and all the rest of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the reason I was came because I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
didn't really think that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
would have brought me to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
France where they had about a hundred twenty

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
five and the reception was that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it isn't

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
place. And

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the labels that. Seven coal.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It started with them in the head

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and then in the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
head

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and it was really

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
nice and then they bought everything is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
separate and then when they got in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the thing. Nobody

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
nobody bringing

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
one and I mean the.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:05:05.000
One.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:29.000
With

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.000
me

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and there was a nice couple that was

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that he was married

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and a couple

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
ladies. And she did

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
him and he

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
was then in Kansas City almost four years that he's been

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
able to buy in for.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
didn't

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
say

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Well children in

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
three tuna

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
here

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which is you know

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but anyway she changed her brand.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And I was late and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
then you

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:12.000

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Well
