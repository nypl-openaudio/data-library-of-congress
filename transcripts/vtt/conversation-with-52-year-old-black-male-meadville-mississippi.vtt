00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But this was a live man out of it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
If you all alone. Imagine if you guys don't solicit own.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You know

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
who might if you had a hole in the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
medieval that

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
don't don't you know what I mean to claim. It's

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
just but if the big man is backing them up in this case I'm

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
all rocks not

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
just backing him up as he owns

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
the claim of but now I'm taking what I

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
know I'm a session id really expensive I want it now

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that's a lot of people just look to the white man if they're only going

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
to can but I know that and. I want to have that sale farmer

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
need.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
You all so you come to a certain place. Tell

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
him used to be used to turn around and know what you want now you know to do

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
a white

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
man not

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
then if you

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
do that could fall or not and I matter. I

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
had gotten a name and you know what you are you doing all

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
of you did all the farming all right is all about

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
expense you buy your fertilizer Paul you do all of what you ought to have in it and you have a you

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.000
know we

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
call and when I did that God made me Jan you all are just gin and then

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
they lit up and when that man status you got rid

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
of sentiment echoed back and

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
my home.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You go to him and him tell you what I want to tell

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you that will hit if they want to give a one hundred two thousand a year and give it to you.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And if you didn't. And then tell

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you that you didn't get any money

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because that was in looking if you was

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
good for the first time and yes that's

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.000
right

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
yes but they give you a very minimum amount of out of

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
a question. I mean then I'm not going to

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
fail and it didn't make a because you may not have them I dated.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I did a town my date of May

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
comeback in case but I don't want

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000

what I've found out a half of my Mama was in work

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
all my life. And to give me a look to do the

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
life because only one time some have time for the next

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
you know the hand that no I don't want to know I'm back but from the moment of

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
attention I couldn't go to school they wanted to

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
go get a crab.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I already have that's why. I'm not a maid was a new mother. We

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
have lost a lot of them own little farm and they feared to get

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
the money from the white cotton on the C.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.000
drive

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of their one night truck first year. If we could stay there and we all get

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
money you want us to stay to get his money back with his wife with him.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
My father knew what it was about big

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
ones for my mother when

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I let loose told him what to do. They worked

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
oh here you want to go. Come back up their ass very

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
like women used to

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
have me

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
on my own much

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
of the ravening

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
unintended by about. Sixty years ago

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
not specific I mean the fifty years voted on the right to keep

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
them and

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
then nobody nobody

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
at a

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
rough moment.
