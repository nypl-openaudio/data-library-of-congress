00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.000
next excerpt is taken from original take W. seventy four.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is Mrs Franklin D. Roosevelt regular Sunday evening broadcast sponsored by the Pan

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
American coffee bureau representing seven good neighbor coffee growing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
nations on this the Sunday of Christmas week and the third Sunday of armed conflict.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Mrs Roosevelt has a message so important we shall take time to say only these few words from

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
our

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
sponsors they are words quoted from a recent maybe the private memorandum and they read as

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
follows It is a known fact that coffee plays an important part in the morale among

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the personnel of the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Navy in total war high morale is needed not only by our armed

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
forces but by every civilian as well coffee gives the extra energy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The study your nerves which are so much a part of the kind of morality. We all must

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
have coffee more than ever before is the America's necessary

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
drink and now we present Mrs Franklin D. Roosevelt.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. There is one thing about the American people

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
when any in the agency arises. It seems to spend them on to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
greater activity and the more difficult the task may be the more ready they are

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to meet the situation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I imagine that is a trait common to all their old people I

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
have noted many times that there are people who lose interest in anything

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the minute it becomes easy to accomplish but who were willing tiring day

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
as long as the problem befall them is

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
challenging facts. This is a trait. Does the American people as a whole.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In any case the realisation that we are actually at war and that we have

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
a tremendous problem to solve because we are completely making over

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the trend of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
thought which the majority of our people has built up for the past twenty

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
years. Does not seem to phase us in any way. Instead of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the cast down. We seem to feel that this is a challenge to our ability

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to adapt ourselves and still not give up the main object.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dave's soul which we've been looking through the past twenty is.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
A short time ago. I'm sure the vast majority of the people in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
this country hoped that we would not get into the world

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or if we faced the disagreeable fact that we

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
probably would have to come in at some point.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We did not think of it in concrete terms. Neither was world with

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Japan nor as war with Germany and Italy.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If anyone said we might go to war with Japan the attitude was always

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that we would be so superior to the Japanese that poor

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
little Japan would be right to all the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
math. We were a very cocky or perhaps we would

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
just ignorant. In any case it had the same effect because it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
lulled us into a state of mental and spiritual unpreparedness.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The moment that it all seems that we never face. What a victory for

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the Axis powers might mean even if it was only a victory in

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Europe with York dominated by the Axis powers and their

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
ideas. What would it mean to us to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
have just across the Atlantic.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Our own continent of people who did not believe in private

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
industry who did not believe in trade union. Who did

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
not believe in the rights of the individual to life liberty and the pursuit

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
happiness. At least they would not be allowed to express their beliefs. If

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
they retained them there would be a whole continent of people subset of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
the into the ideas that the state is paramount and that their thorough

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
web I.E. maybe is now. X. to God in fact.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Practically it takes its place and that by right of this that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
ancestry their race should rule the world.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Ideas spread. And it will not take very long for these ideas to cross the ocean.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We know how easily a small groups of fascism Nazis and Communists in

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
this country have influenced the thinking of some of our

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
citizens and yet we lulled ourselves to sleep with the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
idea that a horrible continent could be

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
bent on making these series succeed. And

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we would be left to pursue our interests and develop our

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
friendships with our neighbors on this side of the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
ocean untouched and an influence. We look

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
back now when this frame of mind seems incredible.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Suddenly as the Japanese planes flew over a wry and our

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
other island possession. And it gave to the American people and in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
town a new realization of what the widow than the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
future dominated by access methods and ideas would rarely be alive.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And over night we were a people welded together. No longer.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Divided run great united people for the period of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
struggle. Nothing exemplifies this more clearly than the industrial

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
labor conference which met this past week and which was addressed to the president as

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
its opening session. He said to these

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
gentleman that he had asked them to come together to help when the wall

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
as they were as important in this effort as the men in military

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
uniform the president further said that two moderators would preside over the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
group run from the executive and run from the legislative branch of the

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
government and that he hoped they would achieve a complete agreement and above all speed.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
He wanted as much speed in turning out materials and the defense industries

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
as he expected from the armed forces of the nation.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Fortunately for us.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We are geographically very well located

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
our territory is so great that it is hard to concentrate on aerial attacks in the

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
way which has been done in England on such cities as London

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Plymouth Manchester or Glasgow Scotland.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Production has got to rise in this country to tremendous heights.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Because we have the ability to produce and greatest speed than any other nation

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
in the

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
wounded. President told to management as well as to the with

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
because an effort will of course be made by the animate to take us again on a way

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
as to raid some city where there is a big defense industry.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And when these attempts are made they will have to our objectives run to slow

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
up industry and to to break civilian morale.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Being ride left scattered over great stretches of territory is an advantage to us.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
It also has disadvantages however because of the fact that it would be easy to

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
spot us today and to attempt to attack vulnerable points using the

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
same methods which they've used so well in the past.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
People rarely worry about what is happening to them as long as they are not directly hit.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But they were immediately about what may be happening to their families. Therefore it will

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
be part of the pack takes of the attacker to rest because many Wickers homes

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
as possible.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
There are only a comparatively few people in management their homes

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
are not easy to find but there are a great many a

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
workers and because they live close together the production can be great

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to slow down if the workers leave their machines to find out what has happened to their families.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It does not mean that we can expect the impossible of people given an attack.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Cannot expect that if word comes that certain parts of the city had

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
damaged the people whose families live there will remain it will not go to their rescue.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We can do a world that is humanly possible however to keep ourselves on the

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
alert and prepare for this type of

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
attack. Our people can know what to do when air raid warning

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
sound if they leave the house where they have little protection they can find new places of

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
protection nearby which are somewhat more substantial.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
My friend Lady reading writes that night after night she had slept under I had a dining room

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
table and I gather that if you are weary enough that accustoms enough to air raids.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You can even sleep through the noise and confusion of a

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
blitz President went on any speech to point out that

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
this means a complete self discipline and putting aside of

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
this no interest.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Every one of us is going to have he said of this known mouth. Young

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Captain Kelly who don't visit plane onto a Japanese battleship had nowhere does

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to sacrifice his life in that way it was his own personal

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
mess and that is how in one way or another all about us are going to

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
meet situations in our with God in our lives.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Labor and many labor and management what off for a quick agreement to

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
speed up production.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
They were told plain lay that the war is serious that we've not won it yet that

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
civilization is at stake for the rest of the welder's well as for us and that we have a

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
responsibility to maintain and increase our capacity as the arsenal

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of the civilized with.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
That same obligation rests on every government with God on

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
every individual carrying on his own job day by day he must make

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
it a better job so that the community in which he lives will be

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
strengthened by.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It read. Son every housewife of the country to run our home a little

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
better and to meet her difficulty is with ingenuity.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We are a very fortunate nation even at war because of far as we now

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
see we will have no shortage of food or of clothes to be sure we may not

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
have the variety we've had and I should not be surprised to see great

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
standardisation go into effect on many

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
things but we will have the wherewithal to keep

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
ourselves worming winter. Unlike the German people who have been

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
asked to sacrifice a long worm clothes for all

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the army. We will have shelter. We will have all the real essential of

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
living many people in other parts of the world will go without these essential so I

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
have them rapidly in drastic take a tailored as individuals we will

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
hope to remember the Chinese proverb which the president quoted to the gentleman

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in industry and labor. Neuroma drew a flood and I

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
will again ing with me.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Not just Wednesday afternoon when I face the students of many South and

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Central American countries and a few European countries. I

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
was strangely moved that the thought of what these young people are

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
facing at this Christmas

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
season and as we approach this Christmas time in a with a rack

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
with walls. I'd like to remind you again to make your donation to the American Red

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Cross this great organization is making a drive for fifty million

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
dollars to carry on the tasks which they know the next year must

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
brain their job will not be easy to do your

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
part to make by making a substantial

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
contribution making it does your Christmas gift. To a suffering and bewildered

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
word for I think that you will agree with me the Red Cross more than any

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
other group lives than with expire the simple words. That have come down from

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
the first Christmas your a to God in the highest stand on a piece

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
of good will toward men.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Somehow it's difficult to think got to really have much Christmas spirit this year

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and yet in the deepest sense we should all of us try to emphasize the spiritual

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
values which have made this celebration lived through the dark

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
ages in a way where love thy neighbor seems to have lost its real

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
meaning and where consideration for little children is as academic as learning a dead language.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We must still remember that everything we fight for today is typified in the

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Christmas story and that then we may not have a mayday Christmas.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We must still have a hope for one. And Sunday this present orgy of

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
hate and wall will come to an end. Then there must be somewhere in the with the flame

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
love then ing brightly enough to give the people of the room the confidence to

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
fight for a new world order in which peace and goodwill will

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
depend Mrs Roosevelt the Pan American coffee bureau is proud to bring

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
such a message to the hearts of this nation on this Christmas Sunday and we would like to

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
join with you in wishing everyone to use your word

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
a hopeful Christmas to all the families who are lucky enough to have sons back on
