If

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the next excerpt is taken from original tape W one eighty nine

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000

Stevens the liberation of it and then there's the family

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
reunion about the son to graduate from high school you say

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to a kid

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
today on this picture I sincerely

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
children a boy and he still lives within

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a ready to eat

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
paternalistic and you can see that turkey on the table looks like

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to do with the girl he just saw

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
happen to stop all our content today she just can't wait for that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
turkey

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to be caught and served well

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
after the stuff after the dinner that bobby soxer was

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
taking all the goodies of Thanksgiving dinner. They're going to be stopped all

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the day just to like lay down to go met a lady sitting

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
down we like to waste a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
little and then after a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
while then I get ready to

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
go back to their own home. I have

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to start packing again those places spent all weekend. They came from some

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of those places that we had suspected and ready to go in that the crowd had a long journey

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
ahead of the things you see in the. Oh I see a mask in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
a place a cup and stopped to take

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
a fork and excuse me I'm a mess. So the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
pepper shaker and the clattering folk and find

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
their turkey on the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
platter

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
preceded all of that big family reunion when their children.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In rushing into the fine house to quit grandma and grandpa and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
proudly say when do we.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Twenty

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
three. I see a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
mother on a child. Taking down his teddy.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Thing in down his head

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
is holding his hands together

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to smother the scalding him.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
How do they not take the stone back to school to this is we all

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
agree there was and we probably both assume this is only.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Called the little detail I told her that Brownie had broken his

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
windows mother is calling him and then going out

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
on

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
repentance. And he promises my bed that he will not do it again.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But mother makes him go to the store who have to buy the bring the paintings in here and have to put it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
down all by

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
himself two

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
very angry.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
For eleven.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
This is a month. She's the first time. She has

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
been expect to have babies only in contact when she

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
sits in the hospital bed in the baby's.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Feeding

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
time. Among the reefs nursing the baby and the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
baby is very very

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
hungry and he'll be crying and that my very soul has given

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
him that I just can't stop looking and he grinning

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and smiling and I believe

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
he said. Take a long

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
time now the next will come and take him back to the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
nursery.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Six bags to five. This is a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
great boy who sat through this.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Roller skating and he had just come to the piano but has helped

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
me through the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Barry ice cream cone and the spray booth really makes those fall

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
down and shoes must do for my bad

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
skin color.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And she gets a great scratch on her knee and shoes.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And she's going

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to run home she's going to say my me about it but this big boy has a minor.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So the Kowloon let me look through any things a little bit because we can get away

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
with murder that way if you keep going that way he's going to be

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
policeman and a good house to stay with that Rice can he come with headphones.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Maybe mother will give him the eco chic but I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
still think. He's thinking hey

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
he's coming at her and she's

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
crying. Oh she's on

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the sidewalk.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I don't I still count on the ground and the knee.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Real estate.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Selling fab nine hundred fourteen. And

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
it was about. Three man.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Real home surrounded by those wires and they just beyond one small has been

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
carried out. By yet through. Our roof boyfriends.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I mean I'd like to now because we can do the rock. Because we have better sound

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
both I believe.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And that is I mean is that. With ice

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
cream. And the.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Release and I feel sorry for that man that he is being carried by

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
his boyfriends team of the respectable men because

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
we lose respect. He's had a suit on and one of

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
his brothers and I just threw it and the other one has just

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
said looks like a car broke loose on cowboy boots.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
He has his hands in this chair a long sleeve shirt and

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
exact I want a great shock and I feel sorry for that man because Bradley he's right

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
he's going to be racing Volkswagen with a rolling pin on her

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
hand.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The very day and they're like in the middle I don't

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
need you to hear every day and I think you failed because it was done like.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Kids but without losing them the same standards as he

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
is the reset button that Moses Sanders.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Probably brought to

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
me. They found one hundred seven.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And they had these two men. And one out and then.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Just holding a knife and a baby on her

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
hands. And then there's another lady she says

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
a national can a lady I would call her a lady. Because she was a road.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
She looks as though she was my full

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
solution. But well her

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
husband has been a faithful to have

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
been one of the major barriers. I used to run who's going to run

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
so full of headway into our lives and I know maybe it's

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
going to prevent her from coming is assumed to have been married. Into a

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
mess to scale

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
her. So she was no ten nothing but men. I don't

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
know but I'm pretty soon I have been with

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
some type of killing

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
those approach I used to have you notice most I live.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Maybe I don't know how to do that

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I didn't I'm

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.000
sure.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The president looks more like the

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
chinese korean the Japanese guy

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
says he has

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
been

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
back home to handle a

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
really big pie

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
this time spies

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and he's landed a full

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
sized Bash on the

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
back of a big

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
fat back

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
then they ran by

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
them all loose trying to make sure my balance was on high.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But then they see some through me pushing them

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
away but you know

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
looks like. Maybe with some stuff I do know.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Maybe this is me. I've got a room to let you have a case of

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
one

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
rock the next fall even become a legal

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
night

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
dress. Just like that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I don't think this is the romantic.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Pads and they

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
go a little higher and this is

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a big city because I can see the sky clear through the red from

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
spires so I don't believe he's saying that a fire in

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
the paint as opposed to my mad be showing

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
his bill calls for money. The men have seen.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
In the Senate Tom I read him I mean and despite the

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
radio play he comes out

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and told him up on the mountain about to go into his

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
room those numbers found in the family with our back

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
money in his bill small talk to

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
him so that we could do make money lose my money

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
scouting already money putting up a fight and he's unwilling to

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
lose money so easily to the point about my I'm

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
doing very

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
well and move on then I'm the only one group of

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
men who

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
carry on the rich man's

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
heart rate dropped

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to a

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
man who is very angry with Rangers got to look like his new friend in the town

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and then he's going to pull something like that on

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
him that he is this friend now rather

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
than he

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
must listen heavily on

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the number that

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I'm

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
in the most important one the difficult ones.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Everybody getting found one body isn't the right thing to do so they

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
put to me saying come to Minnesota to

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
go shopping because if I felt so so bad that you have to do too much

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
fucking everybody prefer trying to set up one of the suburbs.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I'm

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
buying now we have

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
already heard from say

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
it isn't the right.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Ghost and they really have a Web site on

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
West already Yes I may

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
notice and by the

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
way and then we are going to stay and

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
he's

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
just

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
discovered the pair of the front.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
This is pretty badly saved by the shell. And a bit of discrimination in

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Amazon are set in just five minutes.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Leslie power and the University of put the pickup truck.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Well you son of the I could see some very old

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
fashioned

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
cash

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
in the picture after I'm sure that the background.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Comes

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.000
out

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to me this removes as the way she written refinery.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And then I

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
found

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
the scene in the middle of

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the Bible to

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
send

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
the Spanish king and

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
queen and this is a

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.000
tutu

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
is

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that lacking just to show some of them.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I think this is

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
something

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that to some

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Jewish

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:03.000
nation.
