00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
top of the new film.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Yet their brains were funny to me when I asked the because it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.000

Medium but it was slippery.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Your grandma. Everything has to do as you

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
say and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
she almost fell into the god.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
She lives in a garbage

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
everything.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
then they were never the peace.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They're going to let their track.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
nobody

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But the people out here they don't want to have to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Our history over there

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
