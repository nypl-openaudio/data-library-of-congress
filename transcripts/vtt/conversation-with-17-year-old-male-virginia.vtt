00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
about what the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a shot.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000

Did you have a general in the center room and.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Kind of a home video half of the people died in

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the person died and if you have

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
