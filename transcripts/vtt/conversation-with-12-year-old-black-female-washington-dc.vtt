00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.000
right

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
from wrong. She was there because she knew

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
she was she did she want us

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
not she wanted us to behave ourselves when we can

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
be manageable to everyone.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.000
We

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
he. When I first came there we started.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Christopher Columbus and then we went

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
on and we studied about the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Thomas Jefferson and A.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We started by most of the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
press called them.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Right.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.000
If

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I am going to tell like my

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
homework. In there after I got

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
home. I could go out and play and I didn't have to look into T.V. so I didn't want

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
to

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
miss Mari.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Mari was a map on our part.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Because

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I used to lunch with her every twelve

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
o'clock or.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
She picked me.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But it wasn't only me in the lurch

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
with her. Other friends of mine so her claim.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We can actually if you tell

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
us not to be bad in

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
life and don't be angry. Don't be now don't

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
be a mammal.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
doing things you do. Nuff Boston

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to do you.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Don't want to go. Oh yeah thanks.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Like that. Of being born

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
is

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
good for you.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Like a Girl was in the store and you need to

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
say because you didn't have enough money and I will give less to send out the

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
call.
