00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000

French which she stopped after Grade eleven.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
She's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
just too tender to be twenty and you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:59.000

years and I enjoy skating to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
music and exercising music and everything at the same time.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I haven't taken any ballet but I do like

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
dancing. So. Rarely.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
know

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
want to figure skating

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:39.000
world. Special Events in general yes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Not regularly No but I often do homework to radio when it's easy

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
homework.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Well it's my sister's in the room yes my mother's in the room something classical half I'm in

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the room it's the variety of different

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
things but the rest.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Not regularly know.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Not

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
particularly

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
if perhaps French stations sometimes propriety and for French.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
guess.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I was looking.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
In the way.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Yes

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
porridge.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
They was called porridge Cream of Wheat screens

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we call

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the living room. Front. Yes.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
We call that sometimes I think we used to call it more.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Some stuff. We call the coach.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Sometimes you call we call it usually

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
coach just very

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
seldom do you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
just see.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
A little old fashioned If anything maybe.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I don't know. Coach. Sofa.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We don't usually call it that but it sounds more. To me than just a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
field. Level.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Second floor. Below the main we call

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the solar. For

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
recreation. Off and on it's got a printing process. Recreation

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
room and

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000
stuff.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We don't know

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000
just.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Whether

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Well actually props are called basement quite a bit now because two years ago we

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
had it turned into a somewhat recreation room it used to be just sort of

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
hard cement and stuff only and at that time in the cellar so

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I say cellar. But basement.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's in there well now that perhaps even called our basement.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Now actually. School.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Changed. We had a cellar up until a couple of years

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
ago.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Serviette

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
if it's made of London or something I would call the napkin. But it's a

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
paper that's raging with.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
No. Paper.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
What's the last day.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Dinner. Well actually we would call it. Perhaps I know that already and that's one thing it's what we

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
call supper if it's just a little snap that you grab and run with and this we have got

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
to sit around the dinner tables and

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
dinner.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
want

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to for example if I'm inviting somebody over for supper and

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it's just a little brother run type thing I always say potluck supper.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Whereas this is if we

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
have Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving dinners

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
been sent to them.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Jim.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
But you would say gym class.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Running

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
shoes. You must be

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
a D.J. as if they are

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Adidas sneakers. Nobody really says

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
much.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Startled

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
him. Snuck up.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.000
True.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Right back.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Oh yes I can get the term for it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
In schools.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Though. Probably yes.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is another to resolve but I can't remember it either doesn't

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
see their little difference.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Actually whether it's familiar but I don't think that was in the interim. I think there was another

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
one you

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
know

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
it's a company mail saying did

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
you

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
call

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the which question.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Teacher's Pet I guess that's something else that you just played up to the teacher Brown

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
or studied a lot.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Q

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
R S. T. U. v W. X. Y. and

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
said. OK.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Thank you.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But along here in the line

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
there and

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
then

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
resume fast think about how cows wife lives.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Most of my tribe

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
would try to get

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
down around about north so then just a

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
field coach covered counter start

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and greenhouse plow allow

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
allowed out double look lookout devout

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but devote devout Scout guides brownies.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Mounties city council sword swallower clown. Wow So.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Cream cry out we poached squat.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
By

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
trying to read it faster

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
than

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
to

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
just sort. Some

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
people to.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Do you think we are expecting.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Well there's an awful lot of American television of

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
course a lot of

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
candidates by America in that sense are getting more American than Americans that I

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
know tend to be liberal about a lot of things that Canadians are becoming the.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I don't really have that strong opinion on

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
whether

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I don't mean liberal political slant. I mean serve wanting to be open minded about certain things.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Drugs whatever.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
don't know if they were not but I think there's a tendency towards being more so-called open

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
minded and the Americans that I know

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
are

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
so I'm not sure some.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
don't know if you're tough for me if I thought such and such is that or not I would probably be able to answer.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I like the idea stink Canadian but it's

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
probably deserve a natural reaction rather than

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
something terribly thought of.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The community of

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
British American We just find ourselves think. For not America.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I don't want to go through.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.000
What

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.000
sort of

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
differences exist. People

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
just

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
more important who was elected to lead.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Somebody I know was asked Well it was somebody I know somebody I know somebody

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
else something about the prime minister and they answered something about the president. Referring to

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Canada

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
US that one week in New

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
York Long Island. Friend.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Yes I did.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Well the family I was staying with was very different and New York.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I guess is more of what Toronto is busy card busy

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
street shows

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
to produce. You know I like living in

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Canada from what I

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000
know. Just.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Of course American speaking of variety of different ways. I usually can't tell if somebody

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.000
comes

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
from I guess New York or not know depends of course on the area of New York that

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.000
some

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
part of the state for I can't tell the difference

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
between them and Canadians. Of course in the south. Everybody to

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
drag the big floor and the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
whole tank in the Tennessee Ridge. I can't even imitate

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
it a different way to.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.000
First.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Somebody

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
kept

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.000
saying

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
on the rocks. They couldn't figure out what they're saying is pressing that

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:40.000
rock. Just.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.000
On

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the Cap caught things

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
course

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
and catch myself thinking of course all the time and would refuse the cure for

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
expression

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
let's just

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
talk

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
with him.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
When I was a. But I first came back to live on Cardinal place and I can't remember anything about that

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
because we moved away with

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
our three. That we lived on

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Brownlow Eglinton

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
school and I remember. Brownlow that

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
big apartment that they used to be a small house

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
of. The our O.-W. in L. O.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
W.. And.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I remember starting school. I loved that great Grade one

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
teacher kindergarten teacher. We moved away from there in mid grade

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
to over to build

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
farm road and that there between North front of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
course but north of

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Eglinton and we lived there until I was

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
in grade. We rented the area we rented

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
up until I was in grade ten. The

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
house they all had

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
cellars

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.000
or.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Yes.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
When it's in the middle of grade nine and I started to smother grade

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
ten trying to grade not.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.000
First children your

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
high

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
trying to a lot better. Because a lot of the kids in junior high are

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
snobby identify that with the

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
age more than the group but I'm not sure

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
who left

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
so

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I was always a couple of years younger than the people above anyway so I suppose over the bit of a problem

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000
but

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
for some yes girls on the street.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
It wasn't as possible that those in junior high became a very good friend

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
immediately which

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Fandy.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
To Japanese I'm not sure he'd

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
want to do your family.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
But yeah I think she's lived here all her life her parents were

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Japanese but she's.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
But

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:57.000
she's also in the one nine hundred twenty range younger than me.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Did

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.000
you

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
play. That

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000
would begin to run. Yes a lot.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Yes.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yes.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Well I can remember better from

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
younger. Well skipping

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
scores different ballgame to

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
make up this game little boy across the street where we were high jumping

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and a lot of the start off as two hundred fifty six different jump jump over a

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
certain height with all these different jumps and then to cut to the worst

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
bottom half your jumps and then take the next title to do the next ones and so

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:52.000
on until you can see how high you could do with your scissors or whatever your best.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Magister nice

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
to play a lot of different game to meet up

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
with magic things and

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
whatever.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
The kind of.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Which

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
we were on the north end of North

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Korea Parkway the part below i Clinton does a lot of

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
big houses. Compared to the house where we are

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
we're north of a Clinton does of Eglinton there's a lot of big houses the proper The

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
houses are similar to the houses

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
on go farm and

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:47.000
there are the housing but it seems to be about the same type of areas well.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
You

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
just don't need to read it.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.000
This is

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
a story about TO MY. And how they learn to live together the country most whose

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
name is Brownie was proud to live on a farm but one day a cow accidentally stepped on the mound

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.000
of hay where he

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
lived get out of here. Brown shouted but it was too late the cow had rested completely.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Now he didn't know what to do however he suddenly remembered that his cousin lived in the nice white house

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
in town just a few miles south of the farm he scouted around for a

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
suitcase which he finally found near the rusty old plow and headed down the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
road when his cousin whose name was Howard saw him he was not pleased in

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
a roundabout way he tried to keep him out of his house.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
You need to live outside he spotted. How could you ever live in a house. Please don't send

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
me away to country most a coward left me without a place to sleep and now I must

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
move into town. Please help me out. Howard saw the tears running down his

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
cheek and he felt sorry for

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
him looking down at the ground. He too began to pout. Gee he said

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
You make me feel like a lot

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
of course I would I will help you out you are welcome to sleep downstairs on

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
the coach. Come on in now and I'll get you a towel. You can have a nice hot shower

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and wash the dust from your brow. I will even lend you a dressing gown and from that day forward.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
The two mice live together very

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:25.000
happily actually which is.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Looking

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000
as.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Well the guy was sent out of his house didn't really have a chance to show his good actions.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
The Perhaps the other one but I don't know. I guess the other

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
one is more.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.000
You

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.000
know it's fall back.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Somebody.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Be sure to tell you what

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I think first of all the stuff is probably partly to check

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
out background

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
and maybe there's something in there as well as.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Obvious is Canadian raising stuff to try to ignore and read stuff like a sudden thinking

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000
about it.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
I think it's only just hearing this part of to figure

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
out what the cavalry views probably comparing. This area

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
to areas that come from other backgrounds.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.000
No

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
for

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
a front room quite a bit actually we used to say it isn't

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
English because our grandparents are

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
English. So.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I think

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
just.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Putting. Trick or Treat.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And then.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Well not that one point.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I don't know if I did that or not.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Learning

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.000
difference

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
between. These two as far as raising

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:18.000
the two reasons.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
You don't notice when I'm talking with an intern not

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
very

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
few

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
people.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
I have seen.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And I think.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
The

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
same

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
but

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I don't think you know I don't think

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
so when I think about it and say that I

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
have a definite difference.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
So what is.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
This is. My choice

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
sure that'll be great. Now.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.000
That

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I'm

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
trying to find out when I get rid

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
of something

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.000
that is

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
coming

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
to.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
That this really happened.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Well

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
if

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.000
they

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
have.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Question questions.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Like

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
deciding your

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
question would you rather talk about Americans look to Richard Roth to talk about the

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
separatists who never were both.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Question.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
What

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
you're going to hear conversation to reading to think the

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
words

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
very

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
direct attention to.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
This is

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
what the

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
question is not

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:32.000
because

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
they should be less. Different.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
But

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
it's

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
OK

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
to.
