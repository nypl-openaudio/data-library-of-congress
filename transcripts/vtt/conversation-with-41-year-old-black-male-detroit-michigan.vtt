00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is the Cal N.E.H. American English dialect recordings

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
collection tape number eighteen. I'd

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
be.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
grade school were or were outside. You mean both in school and out of school

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or. Well I don't want to have a lot of fun with Again we call pum

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
pum pull away.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Remember that. Let's see it's one of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
these games that was played where kids would line up on one side of a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
yard or street. And

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a youngster in the center

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with say pum pum pull away get your heart and run away and he says that there when we have to run away

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to yell a fag and this kid was tag someone and we tag

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and then that person would have to stay in the center

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
street and you can see if he went on more and I would get into the Senate

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Athena become more and more difficult for those on the other side to get across and so this

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
was one of them and use the round up with one person who was laughing who won.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
know that when America enjoyed

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
some

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
nice.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Oh hi and see. Yeah. Yeah we've

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
debated.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
How did we do that it seems to me that we.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't know whether we want to be it the first time. Or not and because it seems that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I can remember I mean I mean I mean no I mean it and this sort of thing with

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the African hindsight I wish I could tell you but I've forgotten.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I mean one of Paul's strong you know how you can

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you. Yes

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the training we had many of it I can remember you mean

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
doing it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Thank you.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I got up to let them in China I think. I when

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I went on there was you know one hit with a rolling pin

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and. I remember that part of it but I can't remember the beginning of it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Yeah yeah.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Well we had our friend named we had boulders.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We had. McGregor marbles. Went off and we

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
have had several expressions in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
expression hunching I guess I've caught on to the something where. If you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
push the model when you see I would call it hunting I guess what you just.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Expressing I don't know what it is

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
now. About my will.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Yeah I can't recall no other than they had boulders we

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
had if the ad gets to is another name that we call it

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or had.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I just. Always turns out in the back online thinking.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
How do we call that. That wasn't the boulder.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Ball is a big and.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I can recall a rather special name that I can

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
recall.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I marveled. It is game duck on the rock which is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
with tin cans in the alley.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And I'm sure I would put. Wood for the brick in the center of

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
the alley

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and one kid I guess who was it again put

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
his can on

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the stone brick then.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Oh

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
everyone. I'm trying to think of how it started it didn't start

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
way and oh we had with your life a chalk line or some kind of line

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and we stood back and everyone had a sort of a can store this right now the one who is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the farthest away from the land things the one I was five years away would be the one

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
who scan had to go on the rock. Stand and write the rest on.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
No no it was a lie it was a rock in the Senate alley and everyone had to throw

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
their canst toward this rock right that can that was I guess

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
a father's away from the rock was the one that was

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
it and he had it coming because his can on the rock mean everyone stood over the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
can right now you had to lean over and pick up you can thought not the thought of

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a can also rock without him the thing you pick up you can.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And if he's. If he saw you.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I don't know where they chased you. Or not or hit you

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
or try to reach your what it was that you try to not use can alter the

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Rock and what the objective what I've forgotten now but we've had a lot of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
fun playing you know.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That's right yeah you try not to can often if you.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
If you knock it off then he'd have

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to run and get it and put it back in the meantime get put it back on.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Before he could take you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
He couldn't tag anyone with can Arthur Rock that was away as a prize. And

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I can't remember all

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the particulars but we have a lot of

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
fun.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
What a family is this for many of them and some of their

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
past in color

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
you know they care for you know.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We've

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
spent a lot of our time with a lot of hobbies to get us not only games right know.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This make a lot of model airplanes fly and make them fly and break and we went through a

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
stage where you just model airplane crazy or.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Underground Bronx with

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
the hole in the ground one time six feet deep. I guess fix

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the ride and then put it was in a field and

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
put shot it all up put the ground back put all the grass and everything

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
back and had a start down there with a pipe. Coming up products

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
then this is actually dangerous so because it was when he told. All

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
stoves we put on a guy with

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
a pipe up from the ground it was the only thing coming up from the ground when the lady across

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
the street found out about it and he may call the police and may discover

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that up but the underground bunker and then we

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
read about the Wright brothers what time we were going to make the glider jump

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
off the grass can fly it

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because I felt the wrong brother.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And we got in an argument as to who was going to fly and

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I guess it was a good thing we did it never got off the ground although we do a lot of plans we're going to cover it make

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
it out of bamboo and cover it with canvas and

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
whatnot.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And I guess. Huntley Brinkley will be one of

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
nine. Scope ever a net Viet-Nam series right

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
now called.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Not

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
too much for some of the more popular programs.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yeah

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
this is what I mostly it's Lugard can a fifty sport on channel

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
fifty fifty and what I do.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And I think it's terrific. I think they give insight into

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the Vietnam problem it's pretty hard to get otherwise I mean they're presenting pro and

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
con and.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I think it's a tremendous series only thing I think most people it's

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I think it comes on at the same time the other probably more popular programs.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Come on that people ought to be seeing a don't see and consequently when the issue comes up they react

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
on emotional basis rather than

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
a rational basis.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I think it's. It's one of

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
these things were. Persons who are familiar with the

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
communist doctrine and its tenets. Are going

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to be beguiled by the fact they're saying that this is

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
an internal revolution it's

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
not one it's. One of the ration so-called.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Crawford by the theory that Martin Tung has put forth. He

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is not a tight knit that he made a mistake in career in using

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the traditional type of invasion to foster a

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
communist doctrine so iffy. And so he developed this. Theory

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
of guerrilla warfare which he says

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
will fix. In. In bringing about the tenets of communism.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
so is out to prove this and fast that now this is a critical thing

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
if it's successful there then it can be excess for many other parts of

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the world

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and well. So the success that the United States is on the right track

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
as far as I'm concerned I get arguments from all kinds of quarters as soon as

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
people in other parts of the world found

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
out that the United States was going to stick up for a small country and

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
it wasn't lip service and that it wasn't a paper tiger you saw what happened in Indonesia

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
you saw what happened. The Communist Party was from now completely seen what happened after

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the number of countries are bad because you have

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
seen. The Dominican Republic United States had to move in

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
there at the time.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Dearest. Regardless of what persons would say about well it's none of our business it is

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I've been someone considered the tenets of communism as a written back

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
in the middle of the last

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
century and as. Many people. Brave in

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
her dedicated to now the question is are we dedicated to the principles we believe in in our country.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Many of us aren't in. So it's kind of hard for us

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
you know I

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
don't know I'm sorry I answered you two thousand years thing do I

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.000
think

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
America. No

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
no I don't think so I think you give lip service to it in.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
By and large I don't

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
think they really understand it let's put it this way the average American going

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
overseas to a foreign country. If he becomes involved in an argument with

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
a communist knows what he's writing about the average American does not know what he's arguing about

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and yet. It shouldn't be that way because

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
as the principles upon which our society is based are such that he should.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
To be on the

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
defensive when I can with a candidate but unfortunately too many on their say aren't watching programs

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
like scope and some of these other things it would give them the in-depth understanding of

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
reading more than just the fact that Americans are dropping bombs

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
on poor defenseless

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
people so to speak. It won't read the important story here.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Anything that I could do.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Yes. I want to model airplane how to get

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
it while I went around thread collecting the pop bottles at that time we

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
were there were deposits on the bottle. I go around I'd find as many

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of them as I couldn't turn a man and get the money

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and buy my way airplane and.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Oh

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
yes but. Trying to remember things I had all kinds

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
of little things.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yeah dried out no break it

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and the one the in it had the tip on it was

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the lucky one YOU MAKE A WISH YOU HAVE TO wish I

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
were you couldn't tell anyone what you are wishing for.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Rich

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I started shooting star. You know you see a shooting star

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
make awaken or had to be silent that. Also there were

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
some insects

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I think which ones I don't know

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
some kind of insect. Yeah.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But it don't appeal. Well really

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
fairy godmother would come and leave a little coin

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
there.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I think my grade school was unique compared to the one day I went to Wingard here in Detroit

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is over on the boulevard with Grand Boulevard

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and more and.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
When I studied you here reading writing arithmetic. I think you

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
using phonetics at that time.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Me. We had there a manual

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
training shop it was called which we learn to use all kinds of tools which

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
later became prove useful to me or you know how to lot and I've done.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I think our education there with me at that time. At that.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And I generally was in the center I guess of the class we set an alphabetical order in my name

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
in Jefferson about the middle of the alphabet so that pretty well put me in center

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
sized thing. About all I saw was the teacher the blackboard.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And there was a flag.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
probably the government that went on in which I was part of it.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Now

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
these were regular students benches chair the com desk. That

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
let up you know if we partly. Inkwells and in a

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
holding

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.000
pattern.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
If I walked outside my classroom where would I be well we walked in

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
line and we went from class to class in line for the vest I'd be in the hall if that

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
if you want to. Cantor

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Yeah.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Her grass and close it along the hall in

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
which there were exhibits and different things that I never in lockers all along the walls everywhere.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Like a water fountains strategically

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
located so that you could but you couldn't you had half a mission to get a drink of

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
water when moving from class to

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
class. What

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
was. Well your

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
playground

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and your No one lives the shrubbery

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and some at that time.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
No no.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I couldn't understand this I don't think they had any swings during the regular school

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
year but they were put on there during the summer.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
This is the reverse.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I may be wrong no no there were swings. There

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
were there were swings that was about all the lights me but no nothing

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
else. And it was a small playground they played ball and I guess they were thinking in those

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
terms

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000
too. Well.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
When home of course had dinner and walk home plate all the way home. So the

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
speak but after we got

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
home it was when I was all over it was a hobby as I say model airplanes

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
and boats and this and that but prior to that

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
time. We would get together

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
in twenty two other backyards or out me all your old broken down trucks and

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
things cars would drive them so the

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
speed.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Oh

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
yeah you know. I think primarily

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
for talking. Why is China. I can appreciate it now as I look

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
back here trying

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
to get a turn the thought going into class and also let me hear this brother someone

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
talking back then if it's the same individual we all know he's the head of discipline

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and maybe her.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Yes as a teacher

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Miss Henry. We are at me because

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I make these airplane OIS is

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
myself. The very fact that

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I had a friend tell me that after I had left there.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
She had commented one time that. Oh is the frog name Rockefeller not

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Iraqi Is he someone else who had said it there must be left

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
behind Jefferson spirit here laughter I found that this is told to me.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
After me but I did

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
this hand as I say we were so crazy about the airplanes that all we could think

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
was How does someone in the we just completed the damn near a

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
lighted a tell me.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Now

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
that I'm. He

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
was a pleasant teaches kind of straight but he was just pleasant.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Always did like me then I can remember he seemed to take pains with

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
the kids and take the extra time to

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
explain what James wanted you to

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
learn and.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
No one knows do analogy.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
need specifically are you kidding

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
me. There is play all kinds of games on paper.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Current path around you had to my care. So I feel like Mark. This is the

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
idea I guess was just to keep from getting caught as it passes around

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
books. One time for girls

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
here

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
unequal another ten year along here a tad on this on

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
a side of the desk where this raw data Ryan desk is kind of

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
filigree and we take the I took her hair tied it was long we were here

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
long type of and then she was going through to get ready to move it was a horrible thing to

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
do but. I did.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
This married. Daniel Boone. Know Daniel Boone is and they know

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.000
that Daniel

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Boone Daniel Boone with you know

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I'm thinking of but then you know what was his

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
name he was smart. I can't think this left

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
me but it must sound like

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Bono.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I think so all we seem to teach you can't really was smart in all of his classes

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and he's pretty well known the kid

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
you kind of liked him and her number of girls too I

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
can remember names and Dan

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
was quite right.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I think it was a clue.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
There really but I can remember

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
going into the corner.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
You know. Well. Along with

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the so-called done this I guess when the boredom that went along with it because he couldn't keep

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
up and couldn't catch on and and so he was a nuisance and so into the corner he went

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
said toward the corner facing a corner.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
That's about what.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
I

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
think schools started. Eight o'clock

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
eight thirty maybe.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
You got a three

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
thirty A.M. But we came home for lunch had no

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
intention as we left school at

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
twelve or eleven thirty meeting with Ben was back at twelve thirty

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
and I'm thinking tougher. I think that.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
You have forty

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
five. You

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
know it's fifteen minutes to

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
twelve.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Yeah

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
we live on the adjacent streets. I lived on various They

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
lived on twenty eighth which is the next block or in and Stanford which is black or

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
that. Yes about my age.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
No I see one frequently not frequently we

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
visit infrequently now and by that.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Every four or five months he'll come by here and I will buy

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
him.
