00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next excerpt is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
taken from original tape W two thirty

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
six.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Was

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.000
played

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.000
on

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and so much to go.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But I was thinking about that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
last line.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
On the grid and with

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
money and money found that I know his pretty well

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
my

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
view of the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
time

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I read it and you heard

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
her tell

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which would she would have been and I think great that was Secretary

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Slater Florida.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Yes

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I know they had pictures of his

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
wife but

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
he's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
usually not his

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
oh you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
know when I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
was when I went

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
play it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Came

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000

And you. Oh no I just I just

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And something. To

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What I say to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And from the president. Come They are however possible in that wonderful

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
mean do you believe

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you know I said I don't know who still

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to be a lesser

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
wrong. But much of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.000
his life

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
he

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
just calls I got

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
my you know what you know can marry fast or have a telethon.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Would you do if I lost my side of the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
law that you have

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
memory

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
memory even There's a lot of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
memories that I will raise. Yes but

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I don't know. And you live through them and I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
live and don't lie about what I do

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as you said. Power and now from a lot of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
your professor that you didn't need your

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
mother. Know

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
as

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
well as tell you I don't go back to that was when I was a girl.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The limits

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000
of my lovers.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
He's a Methodist and.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
one of these really big

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
problems when she's led she just

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
lies.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
vacationing going to have

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
a special treat. Why. But in a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
way they were warmly grandpa used to call

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the little guy and he

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
was just setting this thing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I guess. And he called.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And that's a reason to let you has to learn

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
to Sunday school and do all the things. Because of your mother and loved her.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So you came from a

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
background and then the Griffin.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Apparently were well tried on and had money because at least as a headline

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Is it also an awful lot of life.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So I don't know what you're

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
in

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Oakland a good try. Why.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I love the fact that

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
genuinely like the first one I believe what

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I remember she was when they

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
went to. Because somewhere.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Some

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
are from the mommies and was

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
really good as

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
a mother could

00:06:13.000 --> 00:07:35.000
be

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
right

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
from

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
the.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Real

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
America.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
they

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
came

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
from the well when you were a child. They came back telling the bastard her different. Body that and then she said. He was apparently killed in Mali married my grandson so that meant probably but had that was a name of that

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
back

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
one

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
lead

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
list.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.000
called.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
product that

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
was a other.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Cover

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that period

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but I was just curious because I know there was. You wrote in

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.000
a

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
little interestedly. But doesn't thank God

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I was playing when you married. If you only

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
have that on the money tell me how many takes.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And all the things are going

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
to be sixty. We don't do that now.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Would step for the very very wealthiest where mine was a

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Big Wally. You have it to

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
turn him to try

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to trick.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And do you have any idea you have a right upper back waiting.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.000
When

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
you're

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
back of the carriage. If you have a first that wedding dress and you have a second a

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
dress.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Curtain. Struggling with.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I can't sleep.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Now.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
He was a burn it later. Yes that's because

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Ned Riley. Because

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I want you

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to have a music in the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
church and that is a saying I'll just tell you

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
where this place

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
is that

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
there were

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
so many of you.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Our memories which you and

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
many.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I remember going to say

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
you know I want I was just interested that where our members and how

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
many take them out of uniform

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
wearing and then did that they intended you are going honeymoon. Did

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
you know right away. That's just a myth or

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
just let it go I don't want to come home

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and get it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And if you have a second they

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
drag you through room royally

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
screw you just

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
do what you're tiny then like you are now. I wish I

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
knew there and it was a bit of

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
wind to stand

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
up

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and play to the know what you. Where did they get them from

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Colorado from Savannah

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and I

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
just had

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
a small

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
little small enough.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But you know you learn different places and you have any of those clothes left.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
You know my mother will have part of her wear

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the bracelet. She used to make a dress for me when I was going to a party

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
was the last time I you know.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I don't know.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.000
When

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
leave and I

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
think I turned it

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
into something that the

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
way

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
so much money tell me about.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
One family. From street

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of this house is where they

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
come here where there was kind of a sound.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But she said they made so many take so that when they put them on the front porch.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:16.000
But I don't never back because when you marry your family we're living now.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But I

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
was

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
playing with

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
his mountain. I hope I don't take that half assed got

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.000
a

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
lot of your presents and

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
money would show me the place where her mother had

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
lived which was a lot of magnolias

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Leslie and then she told me about the house

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
on which the first

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
two story house for the last

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
three years and that's where they got that obviously

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
the sound had turned that all the way they

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
are going to expand. But you know something else I want to talk

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
about is the best just to

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:16.000
do so.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Yes

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
it

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
was cold and yes the power in

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
America our

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
way to walk. Young

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Jessie you. A room. And he was just.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:51.000
one day and you know you.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Don't

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
let the.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So the doctor

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
said we're going to

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
have that

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
you

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
know and

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
they

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
also call that I don't know what.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
anyway yes. Hostile.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Right back up I love

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
her and.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Jesse show she go buy some.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
so I just she says. Yes You go

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
right on that list.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
says and believe what

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
a sad to leave

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Saudi for the past.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
When we come

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
back why is there

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
a

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
question like that

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and made us never fall ever

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
just wanna talk your

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
legs as if you're looking

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
like you're in the

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
tent. After

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
all but after. The going to come back a

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000
little but you will come back for a stroll.
