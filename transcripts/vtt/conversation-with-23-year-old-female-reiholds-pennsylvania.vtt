00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is the cow in the American English dialect recordings collection

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
produced with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Center for

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Applied

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Linguistics.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is tape number forty eight. Sorry to say.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.000
My

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
idea on to get everything done has to be because I work

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
salary anywhere so that you know how my own business

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and like I work to disarm because Newton people once they're here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm here to write and move to the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
stove or they want to get their hero needed so that my

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we can start a charity night goes to a Monday.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sounds like good instead of Friday night Sunday

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
it's Saturday night and then Sunday and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Monday and Sunday there's usually not that much to do in the first place we got into it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Monday

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
night we need to be doing this and I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I started reading before I had my show and they

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
earlier

and they used to think seven was a girl and I vote. You know seven

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
for the old peer

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
all the people around here get all

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I know Joy when I get over as it is only one

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
morning out of the week I get I have to go but for the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
whole but the last thirty four

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Fridays I stored it seven thirty in

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Thursday and the rest to the. If I do have that in stock before night.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If I don't have to sometimes divide two other choices we'll put Not

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
this week I came to Des Moines day and we thought I need to do you know because I'm going to be buying

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
a Bible school. You know nine to eleven thirty two mornings

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
here but then just pushing everybody into the a commune but I have no regular been

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
coming to do the way except this way

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
in every other Wednesday I go

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to the new place and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm watching said I'm

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
in by danger joy and I will become

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
so i have to do that before I go back and then I'm going back to Cheney can do that and then come

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
back and work

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
again for

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
wages or even Hayes a mile

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is just what I cited it's close enough in the window when it snows I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
can because I'm deadly afraid of driving.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So if I don't have to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
eyeball back. So it's

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
not just on one of these back streets. Faqir is used to being

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
able to get

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
home and years ago before my time in the cigar

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
factory

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and then of the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
saw the two of the two men this is before the cigar factory

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
then

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
of my grandfather full of the building and now a cheek. It used to be a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
chicken and like ten years ago. Then for a long time the same

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
day and I

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
started with the hairdressing

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
thing I wanted my own

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
shop but it was a state law is it has to be a certain amount you know a certain length

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and everything else and he said I can have one of the downstairs for

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
show so I grabbed the J.S. to refix it

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
of four years

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ago he said do you work and if

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you begin No I could

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
at the time one over here for.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Because they knew the so much hassle that we had to do and I think they're just trying to

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.000
do

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is do what I can by going

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
to get a little rowdy back there

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
some the kids a day get

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
going for one league it's a little odd I knew somebody the other week says they

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
drew Peyton the blues into a

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
page whose weekend they saw me they did you hear of the blue I

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
said

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
when Thursday morning I said I never even heard it but is that

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
there's dryer is on it as it were but we really need a shop at the time and this is a three to four they're

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
all told in a one hundred No wonder I didn't hear

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
you

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
get

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in from Tuesday to Saturday Night Live. What do you when you're

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
doing it in Bible school when the kinds of

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
things you just working on a project like as a

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
media pitch or

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to see the

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
see the split peas for

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the believe watermelon seed for the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
bee and bird seed for the truck.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I was working on that late at night my grandmother had a sniper sober. So

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
the replay of the of other people to help clean you know so I

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
said I'm going to I smoke in the other room I got most of it don't that I don't have to do

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it tonight because I knew I needed by Tuesday only go to just to be back at church.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So I was doing that today

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and tomorrow. I said I'll teach two to

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
D.S. and the other girl is helping just going to teach when dishonesty employed here

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
on Thursday Friday I will be there and when Dan will be there right away in the morning on the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
least listen to

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
her. So that's going to keep me

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
busy as that woman really appreciates you doing. It's about a year

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and. She can shed a

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
few. The

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000
longer

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I'm

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
sure

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
we should see somebody reach the eyes

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of her relation and then she likes to new what I

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
did this time and

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the children as well generally going to be she likes to hear

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.000
this doesn't

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
doing really give her something that is think of besides she always seems

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:04.000
relieve pain.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Well

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
why not I never tried it before. So says. I can

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.000
you

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
know and then we started a

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:26.000
cycle then you just take all the curlers and stuff.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
here is Tuesday I said everything.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So I can just grab it because usually when you do what I am you know lotion

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and I just grab a

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
with

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
me and

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
just

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
talking that I can usually figure out most there are so I usually

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.000
or

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
time. Because if not I just.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yeah. There she says and she told and then I told

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
them that I don't get away and no one keeps a mother going to go. Well

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I'm just done no I'm not sitting down I know I won't go so I never sit on her i know

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
i'll never get

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
all the fun and the afternoon she sits and watches involved

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
with to then usually because I don't get a change

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
unity does

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
she fills me in what happens with life to

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
relax because I always get up by

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
this by two thirty in a dude is usually a good time before like

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
a lot of people around here work from three thirty or is when a lot have to come because they want to hear.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So then I sort of work at my get to

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
thirty people that don't work

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
but a lot of people around here

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
do I sorta get

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
before the evening when the story goes a lot to my work

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and you need

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
therapy because of one

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000

Where did you learn. I mean raiding the school

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000

I waited six days a week so I could get down

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000

One of those things you have to learn and what did I have to do into the school. I can't

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
imagine Well the first three hundred five days alone on a first three hundred

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
hours you can work on people. You gotta work on I don't

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000

hate. And you give it a

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
haircut to use I when you start the thing

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is fairly low and till you get finished it's

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
so short you can already do it easy with

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
it and you say to new coat it is

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that real hair or is that here but it's not like it's in child

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
so night hate it's not like CARE are

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
so worse. I'm working on a human Haiti's good compare if

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
you can survive working on that

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
single survivor anything I knew we had stored in

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
the song and it was in the fall and before. Then what they do is

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
like by state oh it's three hundred but I knew they didn't need to do

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
is what they call the

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
cleaning that they don't buy like a regular beauty

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
shop and they were calling people

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
like and made the paper deal my mother I do when I

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
leave don't

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
even see us it's to all and we were doll in hand to get your hair done.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
It's a lot cheaper than going in a

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
shop and you people coming you know and then you know but I mean they take the

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
risk you know if you don't know what you might look like to get done with your teacher is logging

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.000

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
home and that's why as Durham in the fall of the years and

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I once I got out

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000

leftists come in to see because these are going to use any more

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
water than you do have to get out

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
water so we have

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
all read a lot of our programs

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
when we had that still so we decided they said maybe by do

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
you know why water and then

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
body two times these said no we can start

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
using water so we didn't do that much from a vine I know five twelve

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
foot books and I was a body.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Well kind of learning was a did you have to learn the anatomy of the head or

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
that you have to do proceed

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
toward things within reason. Well when you're even when you're working on the pricey

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
call port they come on a few questions while you're

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
working like like they did

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.000
on

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
the scout the dog just depends who you are and what your inspectors like you

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.000
might say

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
well you know what to know you on now

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
and still so you had to do the tunes in the Locals in the new blue business aid.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I don't remember now I knew of receipt boards and no I don't I would normally get

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
a song like remember

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
but yeah why would you need to remember that you know who cares.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Can you imagine some lady say my phone or

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I thought I stand there and say What the heck you call

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
the grease. But it's

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
just hard to do it and I think for the read

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
the record was invaded

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
as true and

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
false with a

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
bar to conform to involves

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
rugby you have to knew you had to do

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000
that.
