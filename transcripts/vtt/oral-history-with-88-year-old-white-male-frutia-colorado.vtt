00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
man. Do you remember the hell stick you grew up

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in what was it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
like it's your house one room

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and it's three rooms are this normal of all

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the streets has more journalists let

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
them

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
have the floor was

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
what for Julian Jansen

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
of home plays with was raised. Reed

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.000
moved away

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from there and live in below there on a big pleasure long

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
car trips and they build a

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
big reservoir of love of that verb

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
form spring. It's in and never left my mother a chicken and wash

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
or buildings or a foreigner up or prays it's she

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
didn't have a chicken drownded or homes and

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
of

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
riches of no more the been appearing tournaments of them

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
were from the brink of. Groom

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and Reid moved out of the house for relived a point of the hill.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It's run by knowledge. Crown. It didn't wash of the house or a but it

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
washed all the cruel trick mother's chickens in

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
their home. Never going to see missing like never enough

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
to cry on or just over

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
things when who did who did your father tell was the government.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Who was in charge of that

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
damn rule or the farmers really milk. Farmers

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
own and

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
their owners. No the government didn't know enough to do with

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that didn't have any insurance in those re how to engineer

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the bills put in those head gates were

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
supposed from the crews got a high rise to take care of all over but he wouldn't take care of a third

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
of the heads Bill

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
raised them as a new dam in a just God grant and they

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
can draw the water off. She just a little like

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
us were there any other families in that area or were

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
you how it was in the day ran her own

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
had her done herding of

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
other river because of its spread out over the valley and over fields

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
in the creek her reservoir water never heard and wrote ill mother to up

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
some fences

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
or pleading have insurance or anything. Dave did you

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
say when you had to suffer the whole lot of danger for

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the little more deadly than thirty acres of places and it's rather

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
green of the saved love of the potatoes

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
the DIDN'T large current wave it's got a lot of grain to just

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
green roll the green that's. When you

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
were writing you were out all winter long is that

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
right. Farm homes

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
losing one hundred day with a pretty hard winners. Talk to remember it

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
was really called

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the crew of your first time or

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
two probably really right. You're not exaggerating

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
what happened did you get stranded somewhere

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
or just maybe you should

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
learn form of.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Of course if you didn't have a good warm

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
cozy my hands are

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
free of

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
of

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
pressure but just from cheerful homes you can dress

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
form

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
of motion a pretty tough

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
girl most

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
of the few times I don't know how to going to

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
make

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
working for my nephew appear four years

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
ago on the mountain. Really

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
job

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.000
searches

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
for the didn't never in circulation

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
is done

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
but God is our cause them.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
No blood clot OK. But it affected them they were

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.000
very

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
sensitive strike. Come home you're not been your car.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
The second of the fire for

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
adults never is a nurse. For us

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
from here coming by undressing the side for me.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.000
She come

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
that morning. Completely gone.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I'll just pass through. So she can have the Dr

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
the shed over here in his room and try to get around the

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
spin room tonight if you

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
