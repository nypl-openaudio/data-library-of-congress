00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
next excerpt is taken from original tape W one forty one side

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
two.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So you got married and if you're not fish and fish

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and fish. You're clean and so round. Oh

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
yeah man you can do you finish one day. Please pack them in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
your backpack you know a lot of times I don't finish of a day while.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have to keep them separated but I don't finish one day we keep from a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
certain place. Thank you and then what we fish a dead even in that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
night you know we keep him in the refrigerator and then that morning when I

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
start playing him again I get that cleaned of ones that was left over from the day

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
before but you know they're all alive. So now you claim

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
they're alive. How do you know them well you just get the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
servers and you cut her off as you just saw and or

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.000
did

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
man under a furnace and wash

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I think it be

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
easier to raise a child

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
here than it would over on the mainland because

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of and we're all friends and you know everybody

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
knows each other and that Ennis and if I want to so

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
you'll know why.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I never gave her a doubt

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
always thought of doubt was

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a change fund was itching

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you as

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
myself who are like you doesn't yet

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
have any. Yeah.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I was you. Are you are

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you say

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
yes. And

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I was disappointed that he didn't finish goal but he loves border business so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
well and for him love in water business so well I think he's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
going to be a good Waterman like his father because his father's next good for him.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And he's learned a lot.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
guess too much now people have that have cars right here but I can't my yard to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
low salt water comes in it too quick. Now I have four baskets

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I used to have.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Pears

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
apples.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Great

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
on

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
chairs.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Take race. Oh yeah.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Yeah yeah yeah

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that's true. Do you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
think. Growing up.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And a difference.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Yeah. Change.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
While the changes that I've been is in teenagers. I mean when I was growing up is that what you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
mean because when I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
was growing up.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And I don't I've been it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And there was no going to through the week. And now

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.000
they go out every

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
night and it doesn't matter what time they get him. They have no

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
curfew no time limit.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Why do you think.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I don't know just time generations each generation

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.000
is deaf

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
or that I don't know. Well

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
yeah well that's that the deference is Nala

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
yeah the past is not as straight as it

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
were because our no friend of mine who graduated gather even one our

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
graduation her pass the name let her wear make up. But now there are

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
other children like you more America dad is Mom's and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
more.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Just older.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yeah

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Yeah Yeahs words that may now I was the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
youngest daughter is the oldest but I had two brothers Nate one

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and younger now I know they say BOYS GET THE WAY more than

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
girls but I was never I mean both my brothers

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
was able to go I more often and things that I you know

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I was unable to give them my mom dad just won't get it for me.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That they would do what they could for them you know it did make you feel funny and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
think you know what it. Is the pants that they change.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now I think it is because the way I feel now when Eddie

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
was born I was more stronger and felt more like. Strict.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But now that I get older you don't feel like all those power unfasten.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And you knew just war. And I

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
think a lot of that is that parents let the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
young ones get away with. More than the older ones

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
because they just don't have enough energy

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
to continue on in the first and what that what

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
they do but continue talking to them and in

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
everything.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
do

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
you

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
always roller skating skate dances ever Saturday

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
night ever started we

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
had that and

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
you know what you

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
bought. And in

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the summer we would go swimming and to debate and have

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
picnics fission.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Parties

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and then you know with have them there to

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
the community hall into the wreck

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
building that's another thing to change to when I was growing up we would

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
have birthday parties teenagers would have to write. You know the parents would give

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
them birthday parties but

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
now days they don't have them they don't have to birthday parties. You'll

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
find one it's no great

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
loss.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I just because the teenagers get anything they

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
want and use and when they get a part of it when I was growing that. Give

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
us a part of because we would get money that we would be able to buy more clothes than they

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.000
would we would get

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
off that now between would be able to get and I

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
think what's I have a part of to

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
do.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Today

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Dr Rice

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
this is a case of things you know

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
questions in time going on day like

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that I didn't know I don't know

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the way out that.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
My parents.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Yeah. I've been they

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
go to or like.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
College and even though I'm staying over a year of school when

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
should go to court.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Yeah but still

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
if they

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
say yes. Tell them through your family again so I make sure I have a say

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
on the brother.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I have one

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
sister and she's the oldest. And I

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
have two brothers. They're younger than I

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
am OK junior

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
role. OK.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
OK Did this family do a lot of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
family

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when I was young

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
not saying

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I can remember when we did do that often was in the summer.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
My father would take us.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And his Sunday. For us to ghost

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
woman and we would have like watermelon. Do you know for the children he would always take a

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
lot of children not only us but you know two or three.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Like I would have a friend to go with me my oldest sister would have a friend to go with

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
her you know and that and he would take us on a Sunday always in it but

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
they could never do it through the week because you know by the time he got in from crab and he's

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
just intended to scrap price he was just too tired to go because he works for a man a disparity.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But Sunday after church he would always take

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
us in his boat because that's what we love the most.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that is our main you know. And whenever I remember this to before we ever

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
learn how to swim mom would never let us go swimming with

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
even was a group of people that knew how to swim with side her she would leave her

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
high score

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
card issues you know clothes online she would leave everything and just get out to the

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
wharf and watch. You know until we learned how

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to swim.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Yeah

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
very nerve or from a one time.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Yeah I was down on the end of war. At that time

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
swimmers cry out with a swim and on

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
top the wharf. Yeah on top of water. And they were called swimmers.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And used big boats would be up and then the channel just addressed in the right

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and getting all the swimmers because they would be doublers good graduates woman and Algernon

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and war for the crab

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
net and hours of get numb and this one time I went

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
to reach for that and over I went and at that time I didn't know how to swim.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So I mean the crab net went down and

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Channel. And my job for Astro

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
there

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
was.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And that was before them but that made her realize you know she would

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
never let us ghost woman with

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
her unless she was aware that after we learn to

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
do some

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:26.000
more

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.000
only

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.000
going

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
back and forth. Chris Hill on the mail boat. You know if it was rough enough reason way

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
years ago we had the old one

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
but yeah she's up

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
there.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And one time I want to over there and it was

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
freezing and the boat was full of passengers and for

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
a everything she was loaded and I couldn't get in the cabin so they put

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
me with a lot of other

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
people that in the back of our war they have all this right.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And I was fine as long as I know I could get out. But they pulled that

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
latch over and hooked it and you couldn't get that eight. No matter what happened

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
you could get out and that was rough when the water begin to come

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Ian and again

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
this.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Is ours by love on that lie that I was

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
little I was little but I never forgot it never forgot it

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
because I guess I know world was thinkin nobody can get at it you

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
know so I was a Slayer whenever I got on the boat and it's

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
rough to get out you make sure

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that you know no matter what's going on I might add

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that done so I'm a I'll never

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
forget.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
EVER. It's been rough been

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
really tore me a

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
couple different ones.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And any

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
surprise. People.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But once you get afraid of the

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:33.000
war there are always the fear. You don't overcome that.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
it is it's it's more people over here for the war the news than anybody would

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
realize in

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
talking because

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
we know what the water can do best when the

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
some are saying if you knew how to swim or have

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
a life jacket you more Michael would survive. But not when it's for a

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
reason there's no way you can survive

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
it and in the summer I can do pretty good with rough weather. I don't get

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
a frightened summer with threats and wonders when I get more frayed

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
because offending him there's you

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
know that.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You have a

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
lot done wonders we

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
do but this was been it's been ice some ice around

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
but not life where you have had it. We have been completely frozen for a week.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And what one time when you're out. I

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
mean had to get helicopters defraud or fly or when we were out of

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.000
a heating

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
oil.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
People are you

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
know it's more wood stoves now in coal stove. Than it

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.000
was

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
back then it's cheaper

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
with our work over here. Yeah.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Over on the mainland they get it and then they get a big boat to bring it over then

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.000
they have

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to get off the boat put it in the truck like you did or

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
high end to that.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And everybody.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Yeah. Yeah yeah I

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
strike is easier to get it flare you know that over here it's just tar.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Yeah yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Now and then we had this storm here as a lot of people taken up the lawn.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000
You know for the.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Worst.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Yeah

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that's when we had iceberg site here. Yeah

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I agree. There

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
are some of those that

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
are still there.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Yeah yeah yeah you could doubt it

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
because we walked right across right now

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
right.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Yeah right in this corner here is not the bay there's not just a bottom

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
but after you pass that marshland over there. Then there is about

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
this.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Yeah we get on. But not as much as your

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
does always a year ago a year and a half

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
ago the drudge came in to judge this

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
challenge to bacon

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
there for their army and the

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
mainland people come in there their votes easier but it's all filled up

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
now they might be able to

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
sell and here on high

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
card because it's then raised that they had to hit him saying I was a

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.000
teller

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
voter.
