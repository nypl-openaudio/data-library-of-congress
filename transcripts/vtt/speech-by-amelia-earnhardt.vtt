00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
modern world of science and invent lives of particular interest to women

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the lives of women who have been manifested by a big new horizon than

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
those of any other group.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Confound them swearing as have been accomplishments in the remeasure field as your

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
research is in the home happy applications of scientific

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
achievement gap perhaps the most far

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
reaching and it is through training conditions there. I remember

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
have become the greatest beneficiaries in the modern schools.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I don't have released them. From months of the year you grab you can messes with

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the process of living.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Cameron The things we using and crude methods of manufacturing the sensitive.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I things of the past for an increasing McGarvie. Today

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
life mean and power may be obtained by pushing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
buttons and Kremen manufactured an appealing product of all

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the world are available at the house by the or.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Indeed the arm back down he need not go back to the miracles of

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
modern communication and camp potations.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now Norman has applied science degree to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
play in the home but I have provided I'm dreaming that of economic

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
opportunities for women today many of these are them are granting them

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
living under conditions made possible on your way

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
basically all of them that the system commonly known scientific

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
development is most

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
startling by mere facts of this new and growing economic in the pan

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and upon women

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
themselves from the history of our times is written it must

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
carry card as to bring freedom African physical back East

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and South Australian women have undergone. Their music citing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the cave.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Remember the. I was going through a magical evolution of the last half century to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
be largely credited to the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
current in the laboratory and were translated in the practical

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
use of crude because that's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Labor premiers on them and that a mechanized world would not be a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
playable run and put to them quite the contrary should be true.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I mean can read to our minds which have accomplished so much in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the realms of a plaid

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
pants will unite with the same rule you have them to control

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
their creation. Again. So I'll still miss you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
leave research regarding technological unemployment. Is as bison today.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
As by either resign or production of labor saving and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
comfort living

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
devices on the marvels of the modern invents and back with which

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I am more convinced than is of course there can be place and.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yes perhaps the most dramatic recent scientific

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
assignment in the brain here. Iran has

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
seen an inventors dream materialize by the Wright brothers at Kitty

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Hawk become an enemy back to our

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
They perhaps I'm probably doing but to me it seems that neither

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
side of modern progress can try to maintain Bremen

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
as your little map in the O.T. coupled with utility as

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
does

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
aviation where any sap and Sandusky embraces many of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
those companies and then yesterday them fantastic

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
impassibility the pilot when that way about two hundred miles an

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
hour passed by radio telephone to ground space and onto

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
other planes in the air. M.K. where you have guided by ready all

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
being received it carries parts of

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
conditions ahead. Specialist and then new methods of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
media logical calculations.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Behind engines reliability and quit measured by hired freaks of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the past is all but I'm believe the bull. I myself

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
don't know I was smarter but your carried me over the nicest man part of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the processing to him from Mexico City and the many times across this

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
continent aviation

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the modern Xi'an exemplifies the possible

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
relationship of women.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The creations of science. Farmer women and yet have not taken full

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
advantage over to some benefit of all is available to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
them as to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
men as so often happens in them to do seeing the moon or

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
taking the old public acceptance to pass on to you and only a part

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of women family

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
attitude in aviation they are because of whether or not

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
their families. Self

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
live under such conditions

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
no I am Lastly there is a place with

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
them in true self for women who work five

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
grams numbered a family marm our facilities for

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
employment in the ranks of the leisure time but place and

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
medium Man I hope this movement will throughout all balances

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
of Applied Science and Industry. And that women may come with

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
men the Dr doing their own can appreciate the rock ward. Wrong.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Who have helped

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
create.
