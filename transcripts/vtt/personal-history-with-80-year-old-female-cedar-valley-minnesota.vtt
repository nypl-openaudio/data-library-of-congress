Resort cooking for quite a few

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000

anyway. You know that was as far as working

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in particular.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now that wasn't always easy but when you if you are still at

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
it const naturally to you it isn't so

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that. I can do more

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
than

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
thirty. What did you do.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
My husband was a mechanic except when we were in one camp Well then

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
he helped with

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the. Men in the it's and. And

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
then one one camp that my father had little sound mail and they

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
thought that ice. Then one that was getting closer and he brought a

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
little sawmill and they thought that I didn't need them on ready

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
but I saw

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
now that was reluctant yes

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
almost

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
no.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And producers to how capable those men are We had one. They used to call

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
him

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Big Sam or would leg it because he

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
had lost his one leg railroad

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
accident. And he was a big

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
man already an alder

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
man and you know how they get on now when four of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
those trees. And I went. We didn't have many

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
men more so I had lost the time to watch it walk when they were close to

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the camp and watch him follow those trees

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and I watched him and cut that granted.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So I he stood with that he made his own lake. He

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
never bought ID Fishel he made his own from a piece of

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
wood and hitched a hitch the wires and everything and and nothing

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
else around no

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
waste and a strap around here and he always the men said that

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
when he went to bed he took it off and laid it down beside him he always sleep the

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
lot. But he stuck to it that. Thekla lake.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
On top of that tree just not like the rest of them.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He was he was a man for the cleanest man he think

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
when he was drinking

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
but he never hurt anybody by talking or

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
he was always soul needs otherwise talked so clean. You wouldn't

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
have to be afraid of him

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
or ever think anything about it you know the real Chantel

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
but sometimes you were kind or leery about some of them

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
because you'll never know where they are. He was always he was

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
around sitter Valley for all years and years and years

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Yeah OK. You know when you grew up in.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Into your analogy to the valley. You

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
With into too much farming though. Now I know the sun has the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
farm all over and he's made a way out there and I don't think

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you know what he had last year he had some knowledge there but the beret last is

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
also very.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Well what was it like when you grew up there. It did what kind of how did your day start the start of the

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
chores and things.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You know we can get up early before you went to school but yeah like Oh when we were

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
at that home and went to school yeah you had to get up and so we

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
are buying chores and feed the cattle and so

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
on the new head of the school and sometimes when you

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
came home from school to to

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
your lunch home but then you had to get

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
some hit

There was something that they used to call summer time but

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
winter time we used to have skinny and there was a little hill there but we did. If

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
skis together and then all piled on the ski sent just went down the

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
do and they had a little skating on there but that

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
