00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well I read you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the part of the First

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Amendment called me to say the absolute Bill of Rights.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I did not say that our entire Bill of Rights is an

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
absolute I said the absolute

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
right to have a man were to say this to me out on the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
street town Rasho make

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
no respecting an establishment of religion.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's the First Amendment.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I would think a man Congress should

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
have unless they destine know the meaning of words.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That's what they mean to me. Certainly they mean that literally.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I see no reason to attribute any less

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
meaning and they would have had then I would have

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
known they might not have that meaning now because of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the general idea that it can mean or absolute Anyway I don't agree to

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that they wanted to mark boundaries because there were some things they did

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.000
not

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
want government to have the power to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
do and whether some things they didn't feel that way or

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that they felt that they should have how to do it within what they call

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.000
reasonable

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
limit the Fourth

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Amendment the right of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
people to be secure and persons houses papers and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
effects against unreasonable searches and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
seizures as soon as they had want to make all searches and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
seizures

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
illegal so that no government could ever have a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
say search and seizure. They would have said so but there is an

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
unreasonable and you turn on down term in moderate

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it says excessive bail shall. We

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
require it says excessive and the people who wrote

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it knew the dead not set specific boundaries.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I subscribe to the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
doctrine that the fearsome

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in which. No person shall be

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
compelled to be a witness against

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
himself means that no person shall be compelled to be a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
witness against himself.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now the theory has been the fact that that's

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
bad and unlawful Constitution prevents it is not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
because it interferes a man.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Well if it's not because it's in the First Amendment. Where does it come

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
from is it the mind of the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
judge in other words is he going to fix limits to the Constitution.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I don't see that I don't think I have that power and I would know

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that I don't claim any right to keep the Constitution up to date.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I was just anal orders contribution. Hours battling

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
against in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
real what you thought it was your obligation to sustain them because they work hard to do

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I don't think it's both which I think it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
an obligation to take this country too should I don't care what anybody else

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has decided. Actually mean to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
you our system of government puts different people on the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
course people with different views.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I think it's that they're now trying to read these words silly as it may

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
sound to some people some people have said that I'm either

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
unable

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to because if our if I were

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
not. Dishonest. I couldn't say that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
they're absolute.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Well I just don't agree with them I think I can

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and as a justice I would think you'd know the Constitution

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
by heart.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Why do you always carry that. Look at

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the Constitution I don't know about.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I can my memory is not that good.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
When I say something about it I want to quote it precisely.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I use it. Karen a pocket.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Mr Justice. Most Americans understand the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Constitution and I think most of them do

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
know I think most sure they

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
do better than the court. People don't know I get

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
letters all the time and I get

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
many people who don't have a good idea

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
grama they're certainly not good

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
writers and they're all telling me that you ought to get off the court and.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Go to

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Russia will back to Russia

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
well.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
They think they know

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
it and that idea is all the same you can trace it to the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
same thing and make it what it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
is what they experience.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's all because each one of the leaders that the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Constitution prohibits that. Which they think should be prohibited and permits

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that which they think should be permitted.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I don't think because it says a member the Supreme Court has to be a lawyer.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
There are possibly.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
don't know.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I'm not sure that you should have all of

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
this because if you're going to have a government.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You've got to have somebody that knows something about the basic brick of

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
it but I see no reason why.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I don't see fine wine as day. Socrates would have been a great

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
judge had even of hundred

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
one later.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Not

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that we don't know how many good

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
minds.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Today in America the same today the liar that you would

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
think would be a good justice.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
He said

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
it knows a great deal about it. There's a million

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and many same time

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
many suggest you raise the point that sometimes

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
are indicated. Sometimes.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
To legalize the legal approach.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Now suppose it were to find in some cases which you were

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
considering that there was a difference between what you thought was say

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
or what the heart says and what the law

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
provides How would you

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
decide the law

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
provided just that.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Actually yet you

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
see I have always written

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
out that the

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
object is to have a written constitution.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I would follow exactly what I thought it said at the time and I wouldn't

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
try to amend. Third I believe in the division of the

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
three branches.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Would you ever reach beyond the law judges ever

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
do on that it do they do.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
One basic thing about the desire for the bill the

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
right one great urge a great many people really.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Natural

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
low natural law concept some I'm put it on a

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
religious basis. Some put it on a phone call

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
basis a natural law contract. I just want

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
to watch best under some people. Language today is the

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
most nice and. We do to a custom another

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
government and someone conceived the idea

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that due process of law meant.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
According to fan is

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
decent and they began to write to that

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
effect Of course I spend my idea that that's

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.000
not what it

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
means because that would it does it would do

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
something that I'm not fought I don't believe the Constitution provides

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
that is it would permit the judicial

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
branch of government which is only to interpret the

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Constitution

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and to write it on DAY TO DAY. And months to

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
month and year to year.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
What best fits the time. That's a very prevalent for last.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I'm not sure what it's the controlling the life and list government.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Lawyers a concern for the government is

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
concerned you don't feel that the judges should judge according to what the

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Times

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
know haha. How would they

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
know jumpers and ask if there's the other one or trust just

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.000
one

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
man and one man can certainly not sense what's right.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Gosh you know better than no

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
money.
