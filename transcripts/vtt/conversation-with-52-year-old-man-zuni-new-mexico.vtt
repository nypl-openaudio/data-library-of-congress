00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
next excerpt is taken from original tape two eighty six side

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one were in the boat.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But again the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
birth is something there are some taboos

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
cause no way that we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
still do follow the native

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
way could be a little

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
distracting motionless

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to hear us through the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
medicine

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.000
know

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that traditionally

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
India lifestyle pertaining to

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
lifestyle

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the simple philosophies. Never

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to get so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
excited when you can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
approach the same

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
person sees something that it should

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
be and I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
think all people in the way of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
understanding things in your

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
environment

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is that their

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
sole purpose for everything

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the reasons

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
they're especially human

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
relations and I think the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.000
early

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
pregnancy that the father of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
both parents mother

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to be has to be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
cautious

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
be able to do it in the.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Forest

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and driving down the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
road and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of course the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
cripple or kill running over

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
rabbit that if I can take care of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
my wife

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
eventually

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
cause me to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
miscarry the child will be

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
born

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
tingle

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because of these accidents

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
previous

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
times he could

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
help but it takes a simple develop a child

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
development straight for every function.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Normally like for instance

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
manner. When we used to come

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to medicine

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
man. The reason to cause he was

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
mentally but just to double check in no way should

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
enough a medicine man easily identify

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
the need but you should.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Killing any entity

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of that nature and with that when the mice.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Choose purify.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Do cause you perfectly right.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And then you probably take care of the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
procedure.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But do it right the structures that the medicine

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
man gave me and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
psychologically didn't

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
develop he could like the infant he's been

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
checked extremely thoroughly and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
care in any hospital but yet they could say.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Please do this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
sometimes but of course you have

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to have safe

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
haven. So with the faith as a base.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
You just do that entirely up to that

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
point and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
eventually get a natural development.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And it's your school by starting to your

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
natural born.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So a lot of times he takes these things in an anglo

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
way of looking at things. Brenda

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that a lot of times you see these things.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It has been for the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
husband.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But again if it is so that

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
the parent

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
like deer hunting season.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
If your wife is expecting you should call.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You're liable to damage the board. Do

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you he was going through the

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
proper

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
ritual wonders go

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
by way

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but it may

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
cause some

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
difficulty to be a normal person. So you have to wait.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Charlies mentally physically. Then you have

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to wait to do you need to

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
feel with

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
a soul the soul the

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
cautioning structures the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
parents paternalist most

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
terminals to

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the company. Right.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Respective people that we. Listen

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because everybody was

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.000
normal

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
baby. And lot

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of times. Again another thing that there's death in

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the family with the media

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
family who are born expect.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Well if you see a dead body being dead body.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
You have to

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
see. Other than the dead bodies being

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
brought up into

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
grief and if you haven't been in an

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
area just a little Glenn's psychological

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
effect with the

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Charlies born.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
They normally are schemes just

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
like

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
any person to

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
identify it you know kind of

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
pale in this

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
cause that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Normally we

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
have me twice in the United States

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
or specialize in a certain way to take your

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
newborn

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in and they could visited one of the

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
ancient archaeological

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
site

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
close to yours and they also do find

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
a human to bring it

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
back and I don't really know

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
exactly the steps that they take your newborn.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But these

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
these claims here for cation.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And that erases the pill and that that

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the newborn child. It's natural

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
color so good that

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
this terminates I think or little staff members of

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the nation are kind of dealing with medicine.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Well we have good relations

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that Israel has

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
done

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
medicine lodges for eternity.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Just

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
a couple things here. This is just pertaining to new book.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
think more and more

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
medical

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
experimentation causes. Physically

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and mentally. Indian people understand

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that even necessary to

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000
have a medical. Which medical term.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I have experienced.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And tried to do the

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
experimentation

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
with this he

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
was approached

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the medicine

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
man

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
in the hospital but he

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
was. Really call into

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that for more

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:37.000
examination but a couple of days.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Back. Knowing

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
that drugged me because I guess my wife was

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
expecting one

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
to

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
rent a doll. Going to

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
work accidentally that we should

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
have to. Loyalty.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But sometimes it slipped your mind.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
We had to carry property before it was born. I'm pretty sure we could

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.000
but

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:26.000
again it's pretty hard to tell it's hard to write.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Well

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
be straightforward with you so I think the

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
greatest confrontation we are

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
facing

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
legal

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
drug supply the trade union

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
drugs illegal and sites and

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
guess hard hard

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
drugs as well as of course you're

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
in the zone a reservation. You can still prohibit it. Even though

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
building has green just like the nation.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We haven't adopted that it's been said by

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
previous council that we had as well this community see if we could help

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
the liquor establishment.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
There will be that many

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
major accidents in the highways but

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
again.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I personally see this as a great is number

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
one

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
element within the Zune and I guess if you look at

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Nationwide one of the.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Only.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So really I think that really. But if you as

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
an indian been done. Be under the

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
dominant

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
society with that in

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
your system I guess you're allowed to do.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
That much

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
quicker than didn't realize you

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
only because I personally experienced.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Number one system.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The illness in my

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
life. No one else India and Indian had surrounded

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
with respect. Specially

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Selamat my philosophy on my paternal side.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
My grandfather was the

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
student he brought me to love and you were lost in

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the mother age of five. My grandfather was.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
My mother my

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
father

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and he saw me through the

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
difficult world

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
war and

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
peace condemnation and judgement.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So I was accustomed to

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that and a lot of times as a

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000
young. Selfish mind personally.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But he put me with this

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
understanding what he expected me to

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
expect teaching my

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
basic principles of law pertaining to morals.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Behavior attitude discipline. You know whatever it

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
takes to train your mind for the early

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
development. So I went away.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
This is my personal

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
view that after I complete.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
My schoolbag the fifty's. I was

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
told that I went to St Joseph's

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
College used to be university develop a creek.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Universe developer could get a couple of

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
semesters scholarships. Took some of the academic

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
courses but was getting decent. But my

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
subjects every.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Completed my two semesters at the greeting card with

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
me during Korean War So I was

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
drafted mentally so wordy

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
my system I

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
know that I was going to get my

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
grandfather but it

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
must when you read or forced to defend your country.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
For democracy. You know that I have to follow that

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
order two years of that was

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
pretty nigh tried to escape from

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
reality.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
But I didn't call but all except to the

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
bottle benches or leaker. But a time

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
when I went back to

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
my

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
drinking took me several years to

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
come and once again. Or I came

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
from ready had a

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
little stunned.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Why. It took me

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
to the point to

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
play personally inventory.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Little by little I recognize my

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
weakness. And somehow I think

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
also with my mind and my right to my

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
surroundings the disputes of my ancestors.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I know that several times like you were praying to many patients.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
My mother left me

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
read and finally when I came

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
to my turning

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
point it was that sobriety.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Folks it's been like twenty eight years since I touched this.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So really I think a lot of times in life

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
recognize these major one number one thing.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
That almost killed me. I have to hit the bottom

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
to learn that I have to make an alternative

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
way to eat or to feed the grave was started to pick up

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
the gilded

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
bag. My dear friends I think this is

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
something that I

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
played the smartest thing.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I think

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
this also effects the sequel

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
says. Lee

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
were you know mental physically you

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
both will be trading your own drug

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
dealings with a given person has to recognise weaknesses.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Although I do have and I'm not a

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
psychologist or haven't taken any courses in psychology

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
but I believe in my store poisons.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I use my strong points to bring my

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
weaknesses and I think.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Two courses since a college that is is a great.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Way as

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
well enough to

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
fix scientific findings.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
So really life is seen just like a lot of times.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
What we had learned the hard line hard she shared with

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
others like oh my

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
God I do they

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
will make myself clear with the world.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
What I had

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
before I think

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
there's much thing that in life that we.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Sometimes we take it for

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
granted we don't seem to recognize this.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Ability.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Woodworking capable of doing

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
it and I think these is what helps me to

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
understand life that much.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So I also do

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
it with young people that have lost a

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
beloved I helped to wipe off the years.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
What

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
would sooner or later make a man of themselves.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Like I

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
did so I will come

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
to the point it was suicidal.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So many young people today working the purpose. There still exist.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Especially the place like

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
hereis and bring.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
The arrangements with teachers.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Help them

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
through. Life

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
is. A unique being will make one

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
especially a Native American Indian.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Life is too short a precious thing. I don't

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.000
know

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I analyzed a lot of these things to make my

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
theory because I think I have a pretty good imaginative idea

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
a creative life style to develop a lot of these ideas.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
To understand

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
life because a list of you

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
still face the mobs sudden death.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
But before much more a word to say slight. Whatever.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
However like scum prochoice every minute

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
and. That the guy also

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
help others takes

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
a can that always be a need

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
but it's all a sweetie facing cold. No

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
understanding the cause of the.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Later in life when I look at my I will be free to do these companies.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So I think the more you would surely live.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Use your

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
native son a different way to

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
figure so doing is like ours is just a calculated

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.000
move with the

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
the spirals spiral

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
really picked to

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
please a certain shortest day of the year the

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
longest to see a thing or ancestors were scientific

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:53.000
minded folk and kids today.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
am I was bored traditional

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
board tournament. Either.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
One of the religious offices for eternity.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.000
For

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
eternity. My grandfather

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
of course was a High Priest.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So all the explanation and the structures that I received

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
bold help me to understand.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
It was in service I know what the world is it's a competitive

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
world and the one thing that the

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
world lacks I think you know ways cordial to

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
share with these people.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Was a lot of big cities especially when it was guided missile

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
training other times people move in and out

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
so they don't seem to really get

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
this

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
basic you know cultural need life that

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
we supposed to know and I think this also

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
gives back to the

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
way at this time an age

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
that overpopulated population and Sunni school would

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
take less or less or some of

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
these basic teachings before God specially when young

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
people move away from their birthplace.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Step or in the subdivision areas.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And not enough basic traditional teachings exist.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So I think during court or in this program with the school district

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
provide new services to or students. Of course

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
to little or to stick figures. Illustrate build

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
up this visual aid.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Think

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
be aware if they're pretty artistic people

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
ascribe scoreless coasters they can come with their case

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
because Native American people

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
stick to their craft

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
and magination

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
are so much a similar base

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
that

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Indians and this is the way

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I work with young and

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
old I don't know maybe he says can too

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
much. In a sense.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Just to but everybody today can take here

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
locally produced. That's their

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.000
strong

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:03.000
point

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
it's nothing but pride and dignity from

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
within and so many times I

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
think especially the economy and

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
jewelry black several years

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
ago. And this is throughout the nation I guess

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
the crafts of young

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
people and a lot of times

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
or angle of friends that are here as traders do in the jewelry business.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
They don't seem to respect the feeling that in the end in a

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
way like if you present a crass to one individual

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
by discreetly look at it and shove

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
it was I have more of these come back next time you

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
know stop right

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
there and then if this individual try another person with the

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
same

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
attitude. It's one.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
And if you've

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
tried this much to other

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
cars but he's working speed put it

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
hurts he said city.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
We've

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
seen him take your

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
bill or could be a provider for you

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
know one of

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
them.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
I think Indian It's only

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
slight I've trained my mind

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
to

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
train other

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
young
