00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.000
last

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
excerpt is taken from original tape W sixty four.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Cruiser.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
haven't swirls.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Of but just loose the police record.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Maybe get a call

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
houses and you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
show them how they you know there is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a lot of casting call luck out.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So you know when they get the man but no bones

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
livery or something like that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He and sometime watch this in the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
past but out of the affair you leave us.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Or you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
are right.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That's when the lady get

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
caught with her. She

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
go see see her get caught in a drug and

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
everything to tell who she was working for with a new

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
thing. So they gave all kinds of

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
military is because there's no

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
way to know like she's like the event that

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is about two years.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Who's there. And then she calls the media and then these two things a lot of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
them on the she can go away.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And then they get a bad you know and they get a back out to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
say the least come back the drug

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
again and it is that we don't get the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
time that he may come out of you know like

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
peer

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
like the. And there's this man that they

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
wanted. For the trade

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so like the other people in Mission Impossible. They

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
knew that who they wanted. So they got the man

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
was the jail and.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Soleil they had the big

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
thing is they will cheer and then they

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
head back to head the real mess. No.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
First when they came in they had the men in there. They had a dummy in the back of the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
chair and that's how they get the man out of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
prison and they went there they used the same thing thinking.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
No they walked

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
him and then they took was all right and all of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
this and their day was coming.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So many was trading. People for each other.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So he played a smart because he knew that they were going to shout after they

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
traded and then they all

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
wore blue book whose

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
jackets and so the men were ordered a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
long trench

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
coat he gave the lady change grow on

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
her. And and then when when

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
they when they got

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
another start reading it turned their back and walked

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
away so that I start shooting that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the. Relay had met only

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
a great deal.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
A

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
year or we

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
were. Late.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
When this this man and this lady was

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
fussing about the kids coming over now the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
young girl

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and they say that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
By stating what the kids over the years so many

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
men in the lady's dog. So the couple

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
nights after

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that the magic came

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
back and here broke the windows in the lady's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
house and then the lady calls the call the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
police and then that the two guys guys

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
came in and they went to go see about it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Liz There's been a so they just went over to talk to

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
the man. So the man was fixers cause. So he did listen to wording. He said.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
He was and he said that the man said that he was the one

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
was and then the other Leahy women near those

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the really they call the cops Louie.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And then

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
their lives they switched around the aftermath

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
again. To them and that night. Everything was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
cool and then the other

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
night. When they came back he went to the house

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and he had a girl or a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
kid. And they call. And then.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And then they went around the corner so that the guy went around a corner and that they

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
called Adam twelve guys

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
again. So then when he would get rid

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of so then they chased him and chased

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
them. And then he where you get really

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
really run over war. This is a clue in a while because I'm

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
right there.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You're

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
right. Good movies

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.000
like

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The public will tell

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you who has a

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
nice day. He was

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
ages

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
like and there is act of him and he was well

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
like all these guys where we live and there's like a computer build

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the lights up like that.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And the fillet was there to show he knew karate and all of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
us and they used to come out and knock them out many

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
things. No he's not love everything and then we'll

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
lose as a general suck.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The label get a phone call.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
They had like that so I had this red

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
phone and every terrible record was a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
movie and they pick it up you know and

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
then. The name was on the

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ship. Easily can be so the other man with that was with

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
like they was on the ship and he was out in the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
early and they saw the lake up one afternoon.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And the it is you little bit a karate you know

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
this is the get uptight we all the girls in the

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
thing and then the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
city and then. The lead

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and there was a whole lot of

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
girls and there was this big. Cave with the water coming down the

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
water was down below

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
them unsolicited from a whole lot of

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
barrels and we put them in there. He called them

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
out and he threw around ten or ten girls and

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
about two one out of the time that was it on the mouth.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And then the level they had said a bomb.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So the alley was this game with a little hillocks and

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
watch and. And he said all the girls they saw

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
ship. So we were not

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Alan and he looked down at the water and he saw the ship always down there.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The hour was gone.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Sonny said. And took us one that right into the

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
water. May as well Wally to the

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
ship in the Navy.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Are

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
here to do

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
all of us are the most

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
timely ability of playing that

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
single lawyer when it comes down.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
To that clean come to school then I come

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
from school and I goes a sailing

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
class. And then at the sailing class.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I guess lunch and then we come back to school after

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
school. They use he tells about the cabin clean up and

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
everything and then at that I go to the best walk

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
or play softball or

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
something and then I deal in the nurse's office

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
in the back playing Battleship.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
There's

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
a

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
new

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
school year. All those projects.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Really he sat.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Or about here. There is where he

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
is really good.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
There's a reason. Is.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Is

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
really the ME. Or clan.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I was using as was the need to save. His legacy.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Here. Earlier

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
this

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
year.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We don't go by that because a lot of this was

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
spite. Is that you got this in the in

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the list get

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
down in the got a clause in the saying we want for the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
president and then you vote like. Say I want helpful advice for

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that like I nominate Paul was the second in a motion or something

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
like

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that so they use a

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
younger class on me. He's a president

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
president and with the have

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
close. On the most savage

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
tree we get all kinds

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
of cheers from all the trial. There was it was a

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
truck. Michael Hirsh truck a big truck getting

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
near get boxes box car

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and take it over there get the seats from the old truck lame

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.000
out

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
there put pictures of things on the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
walls. The goalie every

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
day while bike

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
live. In the lesson

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
learned

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
for.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
The U.V..

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They used to tell who it is like to use a sun above a

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
little. So you can see in those

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.000
this sound about

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Lee. He don't want to waste time and it's more than a saying he said

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
this out of the

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
me out of the vaccine for.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
You for doing.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.000

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Dixie you. Think.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
As a young mother is a

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:02.000
horrible.
