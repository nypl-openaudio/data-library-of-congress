00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
days.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
they

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
right

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
side

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the the way

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I found here what companies are in Congress.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Well will take him down the right leg of

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
my lap a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
lot

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and America

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Imperial akes board and the gym

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
right now in the land. No fight for this fight for the backup. That is

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
accompanied by the fight for the background and then there's a company

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
by my name of or good by the name of Jesus

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to get it down again you know why he is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
a failed brain to

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
universalise universalise a real big company and they break it down

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
now B.G.P. dealer in Henderson but it's still universalise And

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
but I guess I'll just find the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
truth and they break it down and try to write for the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
vice president as a part of their broke the back

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
office of the white mining

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
company and another mark in another bill by another

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
name for them but it still all belongs to the same thing

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
with again that it take it rational

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
read or well not a left wing

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
like a court used to be at its core a lose its like they all make for the right but

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they brought out Brown and Williamson which used to be a really big stuff. And

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so now they buy the Brown and

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Williamson and old so predictable. Now I am period until the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Buy from his grandparents. But an hour an LP deep

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and and they don't manage back in this country ever been

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
in the back of a crowd if you had quit after the going.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And yes it was excellent and had weeks to have emotion A with neighbors but

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Sam landed here. And there he was yeah I don't know that

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
felt maybe the for the him why he would not he was not a followed

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
by example by the by

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the American the rails father was another would he go by the Slocum lonesome.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Reynolds you know advertisers camelback amount by Sam on the sea and whenever Randall got one he

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
said well come out and the fields and they really admire

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and just feels love the most they satisfy and need nothing they satisfy the ticket

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
market and I said

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I know it well as that's the little packs in the for him to just

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
put on a show in the old days

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
when I was going to be that old and just if there was a somebody coming to have

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
an audience that was always up for all these

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
policies about and he had time to do that we don't have time and when you

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
come here. What you know now they only say shit to the coins and jacket

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
on down the line like an old Miss Eloise go roaming the Amanda

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Bynes Rosie say Mama Pope I

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
saw this on my own I

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
really appear to know that was a friend of mine big

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
rigs like you Bill was wanted you to hear on the radio they were there when

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.000
they were high right

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
now

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
as a and had

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
retired and they had a square room that

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
was independent and I think I prefer a first. It was lucky to see the one there and they

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
would punish you cigarettes. Just to get you to smoke your family's jail. That's

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
what the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
sound of it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
brow the over the stomach must never get

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
so servers around the world the right to drink and I don't now but I used

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
to get the girl from nowhere near Tacoma to get me a black girl about

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
the sizes too small to back down there that over that family

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I'm like you know your skin color or we were on the

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
bus that as the right to get that they've had enough of the one day that they

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
did seize the moment a great wrong to reach down a better

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
feeling. Please give me a good girl another says that that they had actually the

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
present danger and I can doubt the mother a vet. I mean you have that it with a win because my

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the Jets

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
were blue but I do I left as a one on the California

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
my eyes on that is the back seat made a good bye.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
If it the very right it was good as that by then they said but then it

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.000
make make

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
them in their favor the right whether they go then the next day coming

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that leg of the body and there was everybody seems

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
to it. They never showed you just the sign you just see aside my expression is

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
if you see me

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
with that my Sunday clothes on and the when to drag me an accident when

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
it comes down you don't see the Getting see. Is on the inside of my lips fascinated in

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
other words it's just sort of like cows and and goats sashimi their

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
service bad of the

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
past think it's a look back and let the doing

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
greener alone aside in gilts is terrible but they will get

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
out just the just the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
means

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
they know well the.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Yeah well the in and out all that you see a fight for there's a right good side Martin they got a lot

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
of how you take a little market for this got no plants in the know

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
nothing the second either is or they got the name so I could not it was a clever they're called such

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
bitches the relentless market is Mark. But the most of the circuit writers we have here. Might

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
come second not us out of the plant we have more options than it would

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
have to go in their carts and isn't this a little warm there

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Mark with the

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
rise of the good hope the sudden rise we have

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
here is a big bore if you're in the plants here. Now then they have

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
second riders were

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
willing to

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
come right here. So I get

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that like circuit breaker. You know to make

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
them that good man good good and maintain a precarious they had to come back and then

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and did you know the film the

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the people that may be legal to

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
gether didn't have a circular right of a man and

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
they must avoid that they want to get in

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
there and live together and maybe sometimes when the first settlement

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
was a gift that I hated and waited till somebody come around a man

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and had a

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
change that you don't need this creature like that even if

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
you was outed yourself

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
as the chairman.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I'm trying to well anything out of the ordinary is a

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
big thing that's not natural

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
is and cause the best way to be of course now they've been doing their fingers

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
now whole lot more so than the you stick with the user thing but any

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.000
esteem it's

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
not natural environment and I told I'd so produce and so livestock.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I don't like it is well because the owners are back in

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
market if they do or they

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
don't know it's the his to He who hesitates as

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
well until he gets going but anything out of the

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
ordinary is a big and

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
overweight and I have a few times a man has a he's got to set himself on

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
the back

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
quickly and man am screwed around scrag me several times.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Yeah by him that is a lie it's been said

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that it is easy death it's in the oven says I he said because he could enjoy the good

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
scratch but then in a house that they keep the ice

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to the sail. Don't pat no feet no wiggle no playing good play

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
anything anything it's at right now as far as I'm

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
concerned by what I'm going to Andrew they don't there's no use to

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and he come down with this hand stuck right in his side. I mean that means as long as

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
he keeps that hand to his side right he's been there.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So I think you're on your mind

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
about whether I'll go now to get along or she'll talk to me

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I don't give a darn if I have another club. I get on Nov I should check

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
you know she told him no and have no doubt that I will miss the fact

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
she want to know and she want to know the

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
difference sign that said. Anything that's not natural is a B.S. man can stick this thing

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that is that he's

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
being that mean anything is. No No another

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
word Jimmy is saying about holding his hand like that's normal but many times in things that's

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
fine thanks and it's a fact that

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
the

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
public now that the long

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
line know that give

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
us a lot of fun. Yes they want our space which every day close to

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
see and other words if he were

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.000
a

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
star if you started the event coming

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
to an end landlady Michu is just so that's another

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
thing I like to go down it means I give you six tunes that you have to ring go away

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and that's two or seven that's three zero eight of that's four

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
now that's

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
five zero that any of the numbers want to

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
be opposed to in other words Mr Moore Mr Moti talks going to sixty eight cents in the file

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
again is this what he mean he was jumping you to say they believe they have the other stuff but

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
if he started it with sixty

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
three and he took it that met with the difficulty get back down to sixty

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
six just as water was up and it closed because there was a lot

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
of times. Most of the sun was not knightly much so used to

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
start one of

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
their businesses and the buyer will do that and say I'll give you

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
sixty and but he means he was a fool in the other five.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
But when he done that he means he'd stand that at the end but

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
he wants it's a little bind the other way to the other black belt of our weight debt and you come

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
back to his sixty eight which you don't do because you've already got the

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
financing and they

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
just did come out of the now you're the only downside.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I'm going down

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
can be taken I can get the good market. Steve

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
is receiving the full.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And he hit it will knock out it saving it for export growth both that when it is a newborn

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
agreed it takes

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
a vet so the border with this by the back of me isn't a

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
plant thirty years ago. That's great

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and that's the grain Yes big countersink in the grain of

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
it but now the thing is to get market. Somebody's got an argument that they could

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
market one day and just say he says no I am right.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He says I'm right and he says when I use it you don't make a mistake

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
he says no. I don't make any

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
mistakes because he was just raving and he was getting his coffee.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
He says that if you got a deed so you have said Jim said yes that it's

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in right name and he's dead man's That is this well now you've got a tenant of the

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
automobile have existed and said it's in writing and stays in right and

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
said where the due to the house is

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
right at Tyler that automobile right and says whatever

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I put it on took is in right now so I'm band of the right to call you they've been

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
dragging Israel because it's a magnet for a band that was just a pawn and that they it is

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
then this a is there was this is this is now that the Elmo live and that

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
takes bowling alley. Let

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
me know it's a little bit of

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
a but

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
just thing in other words if that fixes were to say that ticket would a get lost down the back

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
as that is bound to hang up someone is going to say it's come this big you devil they got

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
busy could get there

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
he.
