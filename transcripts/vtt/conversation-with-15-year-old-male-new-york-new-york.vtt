00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Fifteen seconds they're all a dream and then I use a little knowledge. Be

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
these have two other

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
balloons and then that's why it's a little a spy was about two years ago.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
From what you saw on

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
a recent story. We know that

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000

right could you you know like to run

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
down. There you can just do what you

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And then I stop for a guy sixty secs to come

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
