get
up around six thirty and she has to get really you know go to
work and we have you know you have until that fifteen or
seven and then she faces our
breakfast every morning and then she goes on the work but then used to go.
When she didn't she just that
for lack of them were sent in on Saturdays she had to
work and then.
We would. And should fix is where with school she picks these
powers and duties who can apply you know and we just talk them through
about ones not to press around you know and they were so good and you
know she's YES ME A GOOD. You know kind of a cry. You know
have her own for you know that she
can and has been.
Every kilometer the sand where she goes to and she gets the
flags Payson Coke's you know instead right now we're sort of shorter men.
Because Christmas coming up you know I know
that we're going to say she's going to give all of us a call for
Christmas and you know this guy instead of us that is
yet for well actually a travesty our guys
to us as a first person that he's only going to get a few
Thanks to Chris. Because you know a basket cost about
fifty dollars. Do you know
a good one and it's going to
cost quite a bit that I have mine just
to have and scary to know about the caution as I have that now
the school sanctioned their own doesn't look like it's going to get tore through
or do you have just
the other little about a lot of
things that sometimes always
know. Though that it was established and others
are still. Are they are they
as it was in there and I was going to sleep on
that then
then or I didn't want to listen then on the phone and
I'm Joel can I have a ventilator she wanted to
call that you know and don't let it in there first you know and seven other back
up. And then I have a
finger left there and he smash mouth anchor. I guess it was actually there when
he didn't say anything either that way sort of in a fight you know and
that and then mom says well can I. What it was
line you know and I
want you and Canada says well I joined they both
wanted
to follow that catch you

Nothing which are now why you know I didn't really want to know you know but it was best kill my and then.
Then why then I'll join in a
room and one of their plaster
know and write a book of my goodness. But throughout the day.
She grabbed I have
for. You have your get ready.
But then if she
did say the ground and if it don't.
Well she relied on Grouse all that much but then
she was a super And you know this that real bad.
I got a long
time but she was great as rage.
Just. Did you what if she says if you work with our hands she can only
have one of those a day. Well as I get back and you get
one
within the day she M. that is

And Joel. He led this jar there now open the door and roll them bro.
And Joe go listen for that because Mama told him to send going to cut it up.
And she would mena and with the sewage out of there
are you know if I thought of that it was funny I find that.
I you know I didn't let her know that it was
by her it was never
good for her. Of his
jewel to hear that he's you know pretty husky you
know he was
always. And always no risk to run a little girl is pretty strong
to get me back.
But there were
drugs. And then you know I told them and I
know and her
husband my dad came to have a Louis by.
Now it was always.
It was some time anyway and I tend to think was a sign
that they were supposed to go to work for the drone or he
says. I'm militia in the West and that inside I know I had
a film of the shooting
go in there says. Ruby
if God calls you know. Your
boss just tell him that I've gone to the hospital and her next day or so you
know he's joking around you know telling
that sort of you believe
it has a doctor you know. And then they call that
about five or six calls in the morning. No less it
was on a Saturday
I natter Sunday morning one I call
that Mama may I mean they were just nourishing us and mom whenever
she gets numbers. She asked and do said she could I have
just left that she just never over.
But then what happened during the was that I had gone in this
car and there'd been a source that they couldn't say you know because of the source
code but. From the how
around to the dirt road ran a score and a crack. I
guess I had to go up and I
just turned you know and there was director on a journey.
That they were on drugs that I don't know I have no there but his leg
was broke and they said it was
real just just hanging.
And his neck was
broke. In Monday.

half they've only got two more you not know and
then all of us here's one of their six Sherry she's my
daughter she was and
they were way over there and
they wouldn't tell Mom wouldn't tell us that they had a blood clot.
Then they call that
my mom to stop the care
of their day in my charger you know but you
know and then I tell
them. I'm sure glad he made. This is by.
Now I don't know if we are the best I've heard of.

out what I regard as a trip to so torn up
and broken in.
