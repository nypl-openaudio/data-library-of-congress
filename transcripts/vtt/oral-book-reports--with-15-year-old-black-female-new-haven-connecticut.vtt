00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
next excerpt is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
also taken from original tape W one forty

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
eight

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in this so I think the story of the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
play there was this girl she was very

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
ugly and you know she did him nobody care for

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
her. She never been the I'm nothing like

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that she just she just was I think to just to ugly.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You know for someone to care for her.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I think something like that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Never happened but if you

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
read about her brother who

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
has

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
never

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
seen my family or I

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
come school in the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
morning and I see these

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
boys you know they call in Sacramento to a dinner a day later

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
after somebody comes and say to this boy like

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you see I use the good this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
boy his name

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is you know. So in my own when she went with

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.000
a boy

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to it so we tried to see we didn't know how to time boy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So we tried it so we went with two boys and I'm side of town and two boys were related.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So one night. Boys another side of sound came over to my

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
house and me and her were in a to avoid that Denise you. Was

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
there and they getting to doing it after me so I came

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to get what I came to the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
door and this lead to this place that could a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
community. I've seen and I just done that I'm in the hole but don't let this I said

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I rather come out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
why I said to my bus iness my father come

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
so gratified.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But they went out the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
front. And we went out the sex with other boys while they

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
were down the hill and we was really just talking in touch with that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so then we went to my friend's south.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So we went over there to let the boys out there was it would be a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
bet with down the judges see who we could

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
do and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
so he said first to come up like so we thought that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
they didn't do a thing which one you want me to you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I asked are studying the open to stuff like that and I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
said at that hour he was like that nice. OK so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
this one is a stew. He's another

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
real nag and he liked me a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
lot so I went I went

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
there at the top of the black go he will home on the bus.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So I went up there and I asked his brother where was he in how

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I would be doing. You see get T. is common as as us and no you don't.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
That's a good term story. They said no I'm NOT GO

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
think so he had told me that if I ever was to do something

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
real badly in that it was. And he had tears in his that so I don't believe you cited when

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and only when

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
they lack a lot of boy I went with.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
His awful tone is quit and went back with him and now and then.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I quit him. And now I think that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they're still lacking the he still like me but he still remembers the time

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
was when you know when I took time him and he get a disconnect for

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
getting that for thirty years mostly getting he was to go back and really

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
don't know whether I'd do it again and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I think you know. I'm trying to know

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
why. You know where when you break up with so much when you go with to war the think

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that you know maybe real men feel like they want to be to us and I call it going big

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
me that it want to be like this that's why

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
him. He was on to another

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
boy and I've got to move. I went over to see about her name still

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I mean you see learned she

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
said who I were you remember you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I think the same got nothing to do do not end up money Bill

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
mom and she said Who do you think I said I said both people either

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
when I think where all my

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
stuff like that the sedition live a clear message to say

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
yo I sit in there with the two was already a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
mirror there was Ivan who wanted her and I think that would be good.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
She was supposed to pay it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So he did pick them one if he wanted then they broke up.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
They have a back for

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
see the group. We have a ball boys and a group of girls there

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
are more boys than girls.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So a girl is a is the president in a boys of biases and sixty.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So these are the rules we get with

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the Garcias big boys the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
guys offices got a size

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and now we have the service with children that we go and have on leave in the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
States so that is the ministration

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
business. Is it to do with Chichi comes out

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the teeth in the loo good

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
man and they let us use the death even non-SI say.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tina don't like

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that and so. Last night we had a meeting.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
He stated he can't come to LA to mean that you have to be put out and if you can't.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And if he can't get to mean hard time then stay out the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
same as long as they can't be in it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And you know if you come if you come real made you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
know not unless you have a good reason. That's not coming from

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
relate

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to God can take you

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
up not dead zone over vanished you know not a good deal.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000

twenty minute class there then

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
is not my club or. One of my club member board no reading

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I really did tell

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
him some of them I would say you know you had to have good grades. You know

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
be good for the people you dislike that relate

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to the talk about my. And you get

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
them Are they can get on about

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
this and it's getting to go a lot bigger than it is good know

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that if we pull up play records.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Sometimes we go out

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and go to these churches. And they

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
are the last ones to drink not strong

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
soda. Like their.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Drink like that to

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
get back.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Or I asked. The first one if that song

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
was that we have a crisis we hang around so much to

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
get by us

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is that the wrong realizes haven't looked

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
close to the girl you know disliked

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
them. So you

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
know. We first of all quite

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
a mother says you know we could sing a little bit not that

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
much. The need to

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
get back together that we ran

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
aground and see the boys play basketball and hear the

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
name and it is another one with the girl and then the boys want to get

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
whatever police are in there about the business by

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the sectarian

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
guys and sides in the end by really going on trial.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You know if you do something to put your arms around.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
No way it could be staff or home month and you know is there

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
because a lot of the regatta when you

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
get back to there around the place somebody

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
winner and I get we we just have a little media

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and anyone ever tried it out.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
No we did being in the gallery No

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
you never know trouble. We'll just see we

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
make friends with them chanting you know. So Mike Morwood

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is a kook up isn't like that when you tell me Go

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
raise your missile in a missile or an

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
idea see if it's a girl

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
we go meet him is the boy and a boy and believe in a repeat girl

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
know if you know C.C. you know C.T.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
to prison isn't like that they don't want to hearing Mallalieu my neighbors.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So is she there are we to

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
argue it is like you know to live want to come out

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
sign yet that a come out side

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
of oil want you to come in house on it like

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and take a vote on illegal

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
immigrants. We don't have because this is more boys and girls and he does that

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.000
five

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
girls now in seven men with seventy eight boys.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The more there's more than one of the guards

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
we can plan to Saigon leave the union and fight when you

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
lose the number one.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Because

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
we read about credit is this social science.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
None of it. None of the people in our club is places

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and when you have got a

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
relevant nobody's

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
been she is not new you know you can't progress. If you don't

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
have too much then you will act but if you have a lot you know they say she is she and

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
don't like

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:52.000
you know exactly right.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But when I teach like if it is the

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
pseudo watching going to win and I get nothing on my T.V. dinner President No they

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
have a reason for them not to let you go to elaborate like this in a sea of some I want to go

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
to was

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
bound in and if you let the person go everybody else is going to want to go

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
so those in it then that person think

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that he's printed it let one go and a little nervous a

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
little explain a little girl.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So he decided to include where you come in and drink it when the the lab is the best

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
way

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
you know maybe even let it happen

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
because some some kids or know you did they don't want to get plenty of

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
books and not like that they don't work there for something they eat. Yesterday you know

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
when you were and then you can

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
schooling be generous and give all items and she did you give her some and then the next day she been certainly

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
she'd only give you

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
know mostly just she didn't want she

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
could sit down and pray she. Only Want to give what everybody else to give her

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
son she doing you know

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
to the one

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I'm

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
not the same to me now you know I'm gonna lead by saying Well son

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
you know he's my Mossad again and

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
when my mother got a head the lady used to live I as he was like they used to

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
drink coffee and have cooked business single leader with

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
our grandmother. You know my mother didn't think they're right

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
people in those cases they just don't like to

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
see because people white people fight. You know they see the white people get no getting the

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
best of the color and then they want to jump in it too but I won't do

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
it if they did it and come across a study you know with the right

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
business to fight a bit no bison just been issued. They started

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
it

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
and it wasn't going to

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
cry on them at all you know how they

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
probably did because the girl was they told me this isn't the girl was

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
a you know to kind of religion that you can't sing songs or something like

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
that just over with seven or she can sing the song is coming down

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
to the right book a

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
moving truck on a big and the last you who was singing you know

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
it looked like she was hitting a bus you resist stepping on a baton and when I see this thing. And so

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
my chemo readings when they hit her in on it she didn't ask to go away. It was a thing

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
you knew this

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
was no medicine. You

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
know that it's Want to take this one a chance so that the Coca-Cola Company

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
went but they

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
don't because on our web we give

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
back. You know have to be so hoping to have to be so mean to

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
what you know a lot of kids say they hate white people an idea really hated their

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
family that would give them a hang around we don't

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
want this state it to be safe

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
for me and you is the magic white we got a white

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.000
boy Knuckle

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Up here I dislike God so I'm not going

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.000
to

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
know

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
it is.
