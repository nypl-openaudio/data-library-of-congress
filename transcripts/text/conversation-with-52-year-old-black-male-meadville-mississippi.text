But this was a live man out of it.
If you all alone. Imagine if you guys don't solicit own.
You know

medieval that

just but if the big man is backing them up in this case I'm
all rocks not
just backing him up as he owns
the claim of but now I'm taking what I
know I'm a session id really expensive I want it now
and
that's a lot of people just look to the white man if they're only going
to can but I know that and. I want to have that sale farmer
need.
You all so you come to a certain place. Tell
him used to be used to turn around and know what you want now you know to do
a white
man not

do that could fall or not and I matter. I
had gotten a name and you know what you are you doing all
of you did all the farming all right is all about
expense you buy your fertilizer Paul you do all of what you ought to have in it and you have a you
know we

they lit up and when that man status you got rid
of sentiment echoed back and
my home.
You go to him and him tell you what I want to tell
you that will hit if they want to give a one hundred two thousand a year and give it to you.
And if you didn't. And then tell
you that you didn't get any money
because that was in looking if you was
good for the first time and yes that's
right
yes but they give you a very minimum amount of out of
a question. I mean then I'm not going to
fail and it didn't make a because you may not have them I dated.
I did a town my date of May
sixteenth. Before I
would have you make that cotton and no man would call no man look
for a man that was he has on a list of what we call
the land a land of brightness look for we want to avoid in order one day
price we call negative
and we were satisfied because they made him a maid came for
about fifty or fifty you take a wrong
way I want
to buy a
comeback in case but I don't want
to see that in my career.
I want to buy that kind of car we have to go and you better take it over
to what would you have you got that.
Your dad is going to make for some of the day.
Some of the money. So
we can have a big money do you remove your FREE.
Some cold wind and then take from when you
go to some calling for me and we

Never have been of any worth while I was taken by my man like
that and made a muscle you could stay for all the sea
potatoes going by a little bit and
you
know my whole modern way and a lot
of you take foreign fighters that were given the money.
We wanted to call Want
to the cattle you didn't. My grandma was right it was
I'm a phony alone
for forty two years ago or ten years ago.
My grandma IMO and white folks are honest.
Never mind grandma all day and I want to play with
why what she did my husband will never make a
man taken
from me mate or did he take my
grandma or she what you want my friend it was a man ahead
of him to go
girl to my mandible good man
somebody there for good measure and he's right in the night I come out I
don't get up out of my
past and that's where he got started and wouldn't my
master for I know my whole family and have a
kayak here and know about

here noted by no massa forward and miles
around and then the food you're just another fool and
shouted and none want to
go and week out come out later and get him off
helpful for three or four years ago and raise a bunch of amount of NO

had hundreds and hundreds.
I'm not going to give them a kick I'm tell you what to do You did it and they say they don't mind out to the PM so
may want to thank them to die. Every now and then to do it and not do it to everyone in there to
have to look at them you
know because then I get a day IMO
and one of the home with a gun.
You can't demand they
have to find a time out or down run a scotch.
But alas fortify you by the moment but have you remember the whole I
know that
we need to hear
rough you make sense of the day of a
money maker so they were to man the wrecking ball didn't come up with me. They want
to know
what I've found out a half of my Mama was in work
all my life. And to give me a look to do the
life because only one time some have time for the next
you know the hand that no I don't want to know I'm back but from the moment of
attention I couldn't go to school they wanted to
go get a crab.
I already have that's why. I'm not a maid was a new mother. We
have lost a lot of them own little farm and they feared to get
the money from the white cotton on the C.
drive
of their one night truck first year. If we could stay there and we all get
money you want us to stay to get his money back with his wife with him.
My father knew what it was about big
ones for my mother when
I let loose told him what to do. They worked
oh here you want to go. Come back up their ass very
like women used to
have me
