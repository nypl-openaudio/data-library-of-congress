00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is the Cal N.E.H. American English dialect recordings

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
collection produced with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Center for

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Applied Linguistics. This is tape number fifty

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
six side a.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Long

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
course.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
since

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the tracks happened twelve helps me out on plan

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and. I think.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Yes. Nine hundred fifty two.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Over to the city. Actually I was born a home away

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.000
from

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.000
police

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
department all

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
over

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
yes I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
was in Shiprock I was a

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
policeman

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to the bank.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There's a big difference in the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
language different

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to different attitudes

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
different or more

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of the backstage where I'm from

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
some. My the people living today

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
are still there behind maybe twenty years or

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
so if you go to when the rockets more into the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
city it's minimal. And

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
sure people are.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
they don't like to progress the kind of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
competitive the people that I'll show you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
more contact with people there or

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
in nature. But you don't get to know people there

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
or the good people you don't get a chance to meet.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's from my point of view

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
these areas are because we would

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
promote my own

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
culture.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Strangely.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
was

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
raised

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
my father is not educated. My mom

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is mine probably.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That's how he related to traditional. Israel is very

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
strict morals and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
ethics most came

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
from I have a love interest.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And I have one

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
brother. We're both long course.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
My father's father was a police at that time

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the only one. And he moves around with he

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
was in the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
lead in this came to the family.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Most

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
weeks.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Not really well it's you know once you get the hang of it it's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
flexible

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.000
both

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
sides but if

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
you look at things how people just

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
back into how you were taught me. It's kind of the weird.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You know how people I come here. Specially the young to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
fight some

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
strange things.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So to the people really they really don't care.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
This image of people.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I don't

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
know there are no two

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to have freedom and what we have

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
here at the court is the say for example which is. I

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
live with your forces. And how those people

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
are over there. And then you come back and

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
you look at these people to the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
critical situations of how life

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is how American

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
society

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
makes except

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
sometimes.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
In general I think it's

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:34.000
because

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I'm giving an example.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We got to the little

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
boy we follow he had a hole.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
We took him down to the public

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
service and they told us

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that he's too young he's connected

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
with them to do some repairs.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So we just fly like he complained about a plane you

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
know we took him down there

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
constantly ten years old or something.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So we call up to around for

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
some special called up to Salt Lake City. So

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
we took

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
him took him up to the pub

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to get upset because you know he told us that should have been done a long time ago.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So we made plans with

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I don't know how long he had

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
for several

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
years.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
On top of it. You know he did it in one day with

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the actually four hour

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
job of a minute of the

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
people discover them just looking at a story to tell

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
you but it did a good job and he told

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
us we came back because you can stay with it or to come home come back within two weeks

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so we came back down and we didn't even try to talk to the doctor saying

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
we can't take just people. Rep enough

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
if we want to do it himself and these people keep the people down you went through.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.000
To

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Canterbury and to the city.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I'm a doctor.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
A lot of these were only a kind of frustrating but then again you know what can we

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
do in society learn out of the country as being the minority

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
sometimes with the punches. We do.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But just imagine how many other people

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or the Indians don't get the care that they need.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I think that we have look at as they look

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
at. Kind of blaming the Indian

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
for not

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
paying for these

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
medical

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
houses

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
certain angle people or somebody else on the front look it's

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
our fault that. We don't pay for his medical expenses.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's not the people there

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
or that

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
are can't afford to go to these public services and I

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
think somehow or other somehow they get to get the repercussion.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
These emotional

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
feelings

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the striker for example a little boy playing with a new car a

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
new toy and somebody who can pay for somebody with a needle.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We're putting out there like you really are straight.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
But the way I look at it. I think a lot of these people that really needs medical assistance

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
don't have no place else to go is the victim of these people that

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
are getting free medical let him have the

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
best doctor we are looking at.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
investigated some

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
accidents a lot of them

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
won and the appropriately we should have

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
been a victim

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
of this is this is this is

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
true in the Get involved in the accident.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Taking to heart clinics.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It takes ages for them to get through

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
pain and nobody to talk to have to be called and he the prompter takes his

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
time coming up maybe two hours

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
waiting for that it's an

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
angle you know a plane comes

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
in from Gallup

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Farmington to the

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
specialize to some of these.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And I've seen a lot of cases. If they had

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
proper services.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You know a lot of these are.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Spinal

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.000
head

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
injury.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that's

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.000
somebody

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
not related you really don't care

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.000
for them

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
is very slow especially

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
when we go up to the first one of the

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
screen and they come in and it's coming it takes ages

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to secure the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
scene and all of the time but we just don't have the material to secured the

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
person

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
because like a family we didn't

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
get proper first the supplies. We don't

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.000
have you

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
know the best thing we do stabilize it.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And finally we kind of improve for a while because kind of

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000
improving right now because right now we can call Flagstaff helicopter.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And. I think it's

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
just the animosity

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
on the plane you

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
know.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Probably

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.000
all related.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:38.000
did.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
We

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
used

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.000
only

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.000
problem

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
but I think the only problem that I complain

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
about

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
why people suffer because

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
somebody doesn't take the time to

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
get

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
what I think. I think a lot of

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.000
the problems

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
with

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
the people that

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
could get better treatment without

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
get somebody in there. Or at least the people that it's

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
really not

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that they should be held

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
responsible because they're getting free medical. I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
think. And

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
this was

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
a.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.000
My

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
family.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Well we don't take we don't like I said to be honest we don't take we used to one or

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
more we don't take my family or my kids

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
to public health service on the

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:51.000
reservation.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Well

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
was raised with love to see that things go

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
away when you're sick you know you don't you don't.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
We never used to stay in bed or in stores when we have a sore throat or something like

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that and my father's philosophy was get up there and tough it

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
out and that's the way I look at it

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
but sometimes if you have kids

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
different.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Well we do it we take them to

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
two to landing or.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Checked

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and then they recommend from there we go.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.000
guess

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.000
it

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
depends on. What you know all the people

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
are human is aware of the symptoms of what it

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
is what might be like like a heart attack or something. People should be

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
made aware of the symptoms.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I think that the only way people kind of scare them a little too. If somebody is really having the

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
kind of symptoms if whoever is taking care of the older couple or poor

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
little child you know depends on the front and how what they know

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
well and then they should respond to to a hospital

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:44.000
and maybe with that in mind.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
think in most areas under reservation most of the young kids

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
left lead leader of the grandmothers

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
grandfathers or their parents.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
There is not a comfortable with the way they

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
are with the type of traditional It is for you know. Werman

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
home because they're more

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
I think they're better are they feel better in a modern society where there's

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
music and dancing in movies in

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
the north are they trying to move away from these areas in the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
in town

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
somewhere lose the old people behind

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
and these old people don't really know much

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
about hell or these certain symptoms that they

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
might be having some kind of young

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
and then again my

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
father they don't believe in hospitals.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Doing what they do really don't want to hospital at same time I guess it's just the kind of treatment that

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
they get from the hospital that they don't want to go.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
My father you can't take him and.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
My father was an ET was involved in an accident into the city one time brother in

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
law and him were driving down a road and discarded robot in front of them and they had had a fight.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Trip brought it

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
on and he fell for him hit his head on the

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
dash and they took him to the to the hospital to the city in

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the wrong. So gifted took him out to come back and I was I was

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
overseas than this is what I hear he took him back he stood over there for the week and

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
he keeps complaining by here. Problems and they took him to the hospital. To the

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
city and there was nothing at all

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
to prove his

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Lake's wasn't responding as he should as it should. So he complained he talked to

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
my brother who was sitting and he brought him to Flagstaff and they took X. rays

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
and found they had a concussion and were

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
hit and blood was accumulating in there and was pushing against raining

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
that was causing the dizzy and coordination was impaired.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
So this wound on the Phoenix hospital where he had a surgery.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And they could clean all the blood out of there and it's been about three months

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
done and then

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
he came back. Now he's pretty

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
healthy and the you ask him you know if he's sick or

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
something you want to stop by go to the city hospital he will want

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
to hear you. Yeah because

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
he's been treated

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
better.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.000
He

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
didn't need well what happened everybody was he was bouncing he was down there.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
He had my. My grandfather and his father. You know they

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
have we have certain prayers. How man was made and

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
how the

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
person or. Supposedly

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
rejuvenate

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
demoralise there's a thing called the blessing we call

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
the

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
psychological pick

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
another go at.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And my grandfather went down there and you know when he was in the

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000
hospital and he conducted the prayer for him.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
My father's

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
very determined person stubborn sometimes

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
but I respect him

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
because he never with

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
a never hit me or anything you chewed me out you

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
know but I respected him and he had

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
NEVER have I seen him

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
drunk or Never have I seen him

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
smoking and staying with my mom.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
that's what he told me I believe and

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
what he believed firmly that.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
I guess when he does a person on me or something really weird. Because when

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I was leaving.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000
We climb the mountain here. San Francisco pick almost to the top.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And I'm going overseas. And I came

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
back to the States. I mean.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.000
When

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
I came there.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
don't think as compared

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:32.000
to

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.000
well

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
I think what we really need on the reservation is

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
more education for the elderly.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
There are some people there and still manage

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:58.000
their sterling.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Half of one or two at home. To keep the tradition

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
going and that's the last thing. There's some kids up there

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
that don't want to go to school they don't want the parents want to go

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
to

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
school from there are learning. They're still learning

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
like the singing

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
because it's still there. But you can't really

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
look you know in

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
town where these

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
are

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
going.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.000
They

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.000
don't have

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
any I don't.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
They don't know me you know I really I went to school.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000
I know I'm really fine and the really nice.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Like the family of

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
mother brother and sister fighting or

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
or brother fighting the father. And the nude

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
exist

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
in until

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
like

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
me can I go to school you go to school and then go home you know just like that and I

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.000
was

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
never really involved in other it's just the

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
way I was raised. So if you're raised that way you're

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
more disciplined I

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
think a lot of things don't bother you lot of things

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
don't bother me when you know somebody does because I don't

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
take it as an

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
attack or I don't take it as a degrading type of remark. When somebody

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
says you know I'm an idiot or something

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
that another person's philosophy for

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
people either opinion right. And I just take it as it is because my father

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
said you are

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
or with

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
somebody

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
don't take what they say personally don't let him. Don't let other people come into

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
you keep him out because that's where they belong

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
in the attitude and I guess

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
lot of them live in a store up there.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
They have the attitude. I wish to go to school for the learn

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
more I My father wanted me to to

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
learn some of his songs. But.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I probably would have the only thing the family and. Support gotta

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
get some money somewhere to support it maybe later on. He's a

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:16.000
read anyway so he can wait.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Well

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
won't do it as for profit or for

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
other other

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
people or philosophy or a prophecy that

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
runs our prayers or things are all to cheer

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
you all gone. In a very existence. You

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
know my father was at

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
least one of us my brother my other brother in the cell to carry

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
on what it's supposed to be so people can

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
exist.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Let's reset the whole custom and religion is gone.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
That's

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
twenty.
