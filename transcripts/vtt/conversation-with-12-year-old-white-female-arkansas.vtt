00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
give your mother.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well I haven't decided yet. Because you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
know I look at Caroline's you know the whole bunch of different things you know from all

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
of this shit out selective. So I don't

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
know. Do you have any

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
children. Well you say have you found on

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the ground. To wait and.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Then like if I help Mom

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm still paying me no extras.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And if I act over that as there's a dish

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is for to wait that didn't last.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And then she would give you that twenty thirty dollars because they

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
We would. And should fix is where with school she picks these

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
powers and duties who can apply you know and we just talk them through

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
about ones not to press around you know and they were so good and you

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
know she's YES ME A GOOD. You know kind of a cry. You know

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
have her own for you know that she

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
can and has been.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Every kilometer the sand where she goes to and she gets the

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
flags Payson Coke's you know instead right now we're sort of shorter men.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Because Christmas coming up you know I know

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that we're going to say she's going to give all of us a call for

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Christmas and you know this guy instead of us that is

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
yet for well actually a travesty our guys

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to us as a first person that he's only going to get a few

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Thanks to Chris. Because you know a basket cost about

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
fifty dollars. Do you know

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
a good one and it's going to

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
cost quite a bit that I have mine just

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
to have and scary to know about the caution as I have that now

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
the school sanctioned their own doesn't look like it's going to get tore through

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
or do you have just

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the other little about a lot of

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
things that sometimes always

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
know. Though that it was established and others

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
as it was in there and I was going to sleep on

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
finger left there and he smash mouth anchor. I guess it was actually there when

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
he didn't say anything either that way sort of in a fight you know and

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000

did say the ground and if it don't.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Well she relied on Grouse all that much but then

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
she was a super And you know this that real bad.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I got a long

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
time but she was great as rage.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Just. Did you what if she says if you work with our hands she can only

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
have one of those a day. Well as I get back and you get

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.000
one

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
within the day she M. that is

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And Joel. He led this jar there now open the door and roll them bro.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And Joe go listen for that because Mama told him to send going to cut it up.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And she would mena and with the sewage out of there

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
are you know if I thought of that it was funny I find that.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I you know I didn't let her know that it was

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
by her it was never

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
good for her. Of his

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
jewel to hear that he's you know pretty husky you

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
know he was

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
always. And always no risk to run a little girl is pretty strong

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
to get me back.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But there were

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
drugs. And then you know I told them and I

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
know and her

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
husband my dad came to have a Louis by.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Now it was always.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It was some time anyway and I tend to think was a sign

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
that they were supposed to go to work for the drone or he

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
says. I'm militia in the West and that inside I know I had

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
a film of the shooting

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
go in there says. Ruby

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
if God calls you know. Your

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
boss just tell him that I've gone to the hospital and her next day or so you

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
know he's joking around you know telling

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
that sort of you believe

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
it has a doctor you know. And then they call that

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
about five or six calls in the morning. No less it

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
was on a Saturday

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I natter Sunday morning one I call

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
she gets numbers. She asked and do said she could I have

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
just left that she just never over.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
But then what happened during the was that I had gone in this

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
car and there'd been a source that they couldn't say you know because of the source

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
code but. From the how

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
around to the dirt road ran a score and a crack. I

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
guess I had to go up and I

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
just turned you know and there was director on a journey.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
That they were on drugs that I don't know I have no there but his leg

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
was broke and they said it was

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
real just just hanging.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And his neck was

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
broke. In Monday.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Gregory Bryan. I mean if it was

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Mama wouldn't say we had a gust

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I. Mom's a Christian and

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
she called Care Core and care on him can then pick this

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
up and to. Over to their

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
half they've only got two more you not know and

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
then all of us here's one of their six Sherry she's my

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
daughter she was and

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
they were way over there and

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
they wouldn't tell Mom wouldn't tell us that they had a blood clot.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Then they call that

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
my mom to stop the care

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Now I don't know if we are the best I've heard of.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Well as yet idea but it took so much that I said story hours to get them

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Well yes they say that they either disabling the

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
